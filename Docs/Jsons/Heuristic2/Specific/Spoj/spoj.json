Unfortunately, most of the ancient plays are tragedies. Therefore the dramatic advisor of ACM has decided to transfigure some tragedies into comedies. Obviously, this work is very hard because the basic sense of the play must be kept intact, although all the things change to their opposites. For example the numbers: if any number appears in the tragedy, it must be converted to its reversed form before being accepted into the comedy play.\nReversed number is a number written in arabic numerals but the order of digits is reversed. The first digit becomes last and vice versa. For example, if the main hero had 1245 strawberries in the tragedy, he has 5421 of them now. Note that all the leading zeros are omitted. That means if the number ends with a zero, the zero is lost by reversing (e.g. 1200 gives 21). Also note that the reversed number never has any trailing zeros.\nACM needs to calculate with reversed numbers. Your task is to add two reversed numbers and output their reversed sum. Of course, the result is not unique because any particular number  is a reversed form of several numbers (e.g. 21 could be 12, 120 or 1200 before reversing). Thus we must assume that no zeros were lost by reversing (e.g. assume that the original number was 12).\nInput\nThe input consists of N cases (equal to about 10000). The first line of the input contains only positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case consists of exactly one line with two positive integers separated by space. These are the reversed numbers you are to add.\nOutput\nFor each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer - the reversed sum of two reversed numbers.  Omit any leading zeros in the output.\nExample\nSample input: \n\n3\n24 1\n4358 754\n305 794\n\nSample output:\n\n34\n1998\n1\n\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n<\nPrevious\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\nNext\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhendriksamv: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2018-06-13 14:24:36\n\nac i one go.... :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkhanhchung1997: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2018-06-06 12:01:47\n\nwhen you got result, you need to reverse it again.

Given two numbers and\nthe requested operation, you are to compute the result and print it in the\nform specified below. With addition and subtraction, the numbers are written\nbelow each other.

If the second number has more than one digit, print another horizontal\nline under the partial results, and then print the sum of them.\n\n\nThere must be minimal number of spaces on the beginning of lines, with\nrespect to other constraints. The horizontal line is always as long as\nnecessary to reach the left and right end of both numbers (and operators)\ndirectly below and above it.

As you may expect, she played\nmostly Antique Comedies most of all. All the people loved her. But she was not\ninterested in the crowds. Her big hobby were beads of any kind. Many bead\nmakers were working for her and they manufactured new necklaces and\nbracelets every day. One day she called her main Inspector of Bead\nMakers (IBM) and told him she wanted a very long and special\nnecklace.\n\nThe necklace should be made of glass beads of different sizes connected\nto each other but without any thread running through the beads, so that\nmeans the beads can be disconnected at any point. The actress chose the\nsuccession of beads she wants to have and the IBM promised to make the\nnecklace. But then he realized a problem. The joint between two neighbouring\nbeads is not very robust so it is possible that the necklace will get torn\nby its own weight. The situation becomes even worse when the necklace is\ndisjoined. Moreover, the point of disconnection is very important. If there\nare small beads at the beginning, the possibility of tearing is much higher\nthan if there were large beads. IBM wants to test the robustness of a\nnecklace so he needs a program that will be able to determine the worst\npossible point of disjoining the beads.\n\nThe description of the necklace is a string A =\na1a2 ... am\nspecifying sizes of the particular beads, where the last character\nam is considered to precede character\na1 in circular fashion. \n\nThe disjoint point i is said to be worse than the disjoint\npoint j if and only if the string\naiai+1 ... ana1 ...\nai-1 is lexicografically smaller than the string\najaj+1 ... ana1 ...\naj-1.\nString a1a2 ... an is\nlexicografically smaller than the string\nb1b2 ... bn if and only if there\nexists an integer i, i <= n, so that\naj=bj, for each j, 1 <= j <\ni and ai < bi.\n\n\nInput\nThe input consists of N cases.

The actress chose the\nsuccession of beads she wants to have and the IBM promised to make the\nnecklace. But then he realized a problem. The joint between two neighbouring\nbeads is not very robust so it is possible that the necklace will get torn\nby its own weight. The situation becomes even worse when the necklace is\ndisjoined. Moreover, the point of disconnection is very important. If there\nare small beads at the beginning, the possibility of tearing is much higher\nthan if there were large beads. IBM wants to test the robustness of a\nnecklace so he needs a program that will be able to determine the worst\npossible point of disjoining the beads.\n\nThe description of the necklace is a string A =\na1a2 ... am\nspecifying sizes of the particular beads, where the last character\nam is considered to precede character\na1 in circular fashion. \n\nThe disjoint point i is said to be worse than the disjoint\npoint j if and only if the string\naiai+1 ... ana1 ...\nai-1 is lexicografically smaller than the string\najaj+1 ... ana1 ...\naj-1.\nString a1a2 ... an is\nlexicografically smaller than the string\nb1b2 ... bn if and only if there\nexists an integer i, i <= n, so that\naj=bj, for each j, 1 <= j <\ni and ai < bi.\n\n"

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOKS1 - Copying Books\n\n\n#binary-search\n\n\n\n\nBefore the invention of book-printing, it was very hard to make a copy of a book. All the contents had to be re-written by hand by so called scribers. The scriber had been given a book and after several months he finished its copy. One of the most famous scribers lived in the 15th century and his name was Xaverius Endricus Remius Ontius Xendrianus (Xerox). Anyway, the work was very annoying and boring. And the only way to speed it up was to hire more scribers.\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a theater ensemble that wanted to play famous Antique Tragedies. The scripts of these plays were divided into many books and actors needed more copies of them, of course. So they hired many scribers to make copies of these books. Imagine you have m books (numbered 1, 2 ... m) that may have different number of pages (p1, p2 ... pm) and you want to make one copy of each of them. Your task is to divide these books among k scribes, k <= m. Each book can be assigned to a single scriber only, and every scriber must get a continuous sequence of books. That means, there exists an increasing succession of numbers 0 = b0 < b1 < b2, ... < bk-1 <= bk = m such that i-th scriber gets a sequence of books with numbers between bi-1+1 and bi. The time needed to make a copy of all the books is determined by the scriber who was assigned the most work. Therefore, our goal is to minimize the maximum number of pages assigned to a single scriber. Your task is to find the optimal assignment.\nInput\nThe input consists of N cases (equal to about 200). The first line of the input contains only positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case consists of exactly two lines. At the first line, there are two integers m and k, 1 <= k <= m <= 500. At the second line, there are integers p1, p2, ... pm separated by spaces. All these values are positive and less than 10000000.\nOutput\nFor each case, print exactly one line. The line must contain the input succession p1, p2, ... pm divided into exactly k parts such that the maximum sum of a single part should be as small as possible. Use the slash character ('/') to separate the parts. There must be exactly one space character between any two successive numbers and between the number and the slash.\nIf there is more than one solution, print the one that minimizes the work\nassigned to the first scriber, then to the second scriber etc. But each\nscriber must be assigned at least one book.\nExample\nSample input:\n2\n9 3\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\n5 4\n100 100 100 100 100\n\nSample output:\n100 200 300 400 500 / 600 700 / 800 900\n100 / 100 / 100 / 100 100\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n<\nPrevious\n1\n2\nNext\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nojvietnam: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2018-06-06 08:28:45\n\n:3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshpek_i_luk42: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-11-12 21:57:02\n\n\nLast edit: 2017-11-13 09:15:41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmorino_hikari: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-08-05 04:57:21\n\n@khanhpqbk, You can try to do a greedy collection of the elements (until the next one cannot be collected because of the maximal value you have obtained or there is less elements than the scribers)from the end of the sequence to the beginning.

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBULK - The Bulk!\n\n\nno tags\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nACM uses a\u00a0new special technology of building its transceiver stations. This technology is called Modular Cuboid Architecture (MCA) and is covered by a\u00a0patent of Lego company. All parts of the transceiver are shipped in unit blocks that have the form of cubes of exactly the same size. The cubes can be then connected to each other. The MCA is modular architecture, that means we can select preferred transceiver configuration and buy only those components we need .\nThe cubes must be always connected \"face-to-face\", i.e. the whole side of one cube is connected to the whole side of another cube. One cube can be thus connected to at most six other units. The resulting equipment, consisting of unit cubes is called The Bulk in the communication technology slang.\nSometimes, an\u00a0old and unneeded bulk is condemned, put into a\u00a0storage place, and replaced with a\u00a0new one. It was recently found that ACM has many of such old bulks that just occupy space and are no longer needed. The director has decided that all such bulks must be disassembled to single pieces to save some space. Unfortunately, there is no documentation for the old bulks and nobody knows the exact number of pieces that form them. You are to write a\u00a0computer program that takes the bulk description and computes the number of unit cubes.\nEach bulk is described by its faces (sides). A\u00a0special X-ray based machine was constructed that is able to localise all faces of the bulk in the space, even the inner faces, because the bulk can be partially hollow (it can contain empty spaces inside). But any bulk must be connected (i.e. it cannot drop into two pieces) and composed of whole unit cubes.\n\u00a0\nInput\nThere is a\u00a0single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 1000). It stands for the number of bulks to follow. Each bulk description begins with a\u00a0line containing single positive integer F, 6 <= F <= 250, stating the number of faces. Then there are F lines, each containing one face description. All faces of the bulk are always listed, in any order. Any face may be divided into several distinct parts and described like if it was more faces. Faces do not overlap. Every face has one inner side and one outer side. No side can be \"partially inner and partially outer\".\nEach face is described on a\u00a0single line. The line begins with an\u00a0integer number P stating the number of points that determine the face, 4 <= P <= 200. Then there are 3 x P numbers, coordinates of the points. Each point is described by three coordinates X,Y,Z (0 <= X,Y,Z <= 1000) separated by spaces. The points are separated from each other and from the number P by two space characters. These additional spaces were added to make the input more human readable. The face can be constructed by connecting the points in the specified order, plus connecting the last point with the first one.\nThe face is always composed of \"unit squares\", that means every edge runs either in X, Y or Z-axis direction. If we take any two neighbouring points X1,Y1,Z1 and   X2,Y2,Z2, then the points will always differ in exactly one of the three coordinates. I.e. it is either  X1 <> X2, or  Y1 <> Y2, or   Z1 <> Z2, other two coordinates are the same. Every face lies in an\u00a0orthogonal plane, i.e. exactly one coordinate is always the same for all points of the face. The face outline will never touch nor cross itself.\n\u00a0\nOutput\nYour program must print a\u00a0single line for every test case. The line must contain the sentence The bulk is composed of V units., where V is the volume of the bulk.\nExample\nSample Input:\n2\n12\n4  10 10 10  10 10 20  10 20 20  10 20 10\n4  20 10 10  20 10 20  20 20 20  20 20 10\n4  10 10 10  10 10 20  20 10 20  20 10 10\n4  10 20 10  10 20 20  20 20 20  20 20 10\n4  10 10 10  10 20 10  20 20 10  20 10 10\n5  10 10 20  10 20 20  20 20 20  20 15 20  20 10 20\n4  14 14 14  14 14 16  14 16 16  14 16 14\n4  16 14 14  16 14 16  16 16 16  16 16 14\n4  14 14 14  14 14 16  16 14 16  16 14 14\n4  14 16 14  14 16 16  16 16 16  16 16 14\n4  14 14 14  14 16 14  16 16 14  16 14 14\n4  14 14 16  14 16 16  16 16 16  16 14 16\n12\n4  20 20 30  20 30 30  30 30 30  30 20 30\n4  10 10 10  10 40 10  40 40 10  40 10 10\n6  10 10 20  20 10 20  20 30 20  30 30 20  30 40 20  10 40 20\n6  20 10 20  20 20 20  30 20 20  30 40 20  40 40 20  40 10 20\n4  10 10 10  40 10 10  40 10 20  10 10 20\n4  10 40 10  40 40 10  40 40 20  10 40 20\n4  20 20 20  30 20 20  30 20 30  20 20 30\n4  20 30 20  30 30 20  30 30 30  20 30 30\n4  10 10 10  10 40 10  10 40 20  10 10 20\n4  40 10 10  40 40 10  40 40 20  40 10 20\n4  20 20 20  20 30 20  20 30 30  20 20 30\n4  30 20 20  30 30 20  30 30 30  30 20 30\n\n\nSample Output:\nThe bulk is composed of 992 units.\nThe bulk is composed of 10000 units.\n\nWarning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n<\nPrevious\n1\n2\nNext\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbabu_nitdgp: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-03-27 05:37:38\n\n\nLast edit: 2017-03-27 05:37:51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnkumar_1896: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-03-20 14:27:41\n\ncan anyone help me, i don't understand the problem??\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsouvikdc: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2016-12-23 05:09:51\n\nCan anyone please tell me that how a five edged face can have all the interior angles <=90 degrees and how all of its edges are parallel to the orthogonal plane?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nortemis: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2016-05-05 18:32:49\n\nHere are models of the 2 examples in the sample input:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/VHyhz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZaf: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2016-04-18 11:27:07\n\nIf a face has a hole in it, it is described as 2 faces which touch each other but leave a hole between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Bi: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2016-02-07 00:38:41\n\nHow is a face described if it has a hole in it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niamayushanand: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2016-01-22 11:42:56\n\nCan anyone please help me?

Sometimes it is very easy to answer,\nsometimes it could be pretty hard. Because these \"sequence problems\" are very\npopular, ACM wants to implement them into the \"Free Time\" section of their\nnew WAP portal.\n\n\nACM programmers have noticed that some of the quizzes can be solved by\ndescribing the sequence by polynomials. For example, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\ncan be easily understood as a\u00a0trivial polynomial. The next number is 6. But even\nmore complex sequences, like 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, can be described by a\u00a0polynomial.\nIn this case, \n1/2.n2-1/2.n+1 can be used. Note that even\nif the members of the sequence are integers, polynomial coefficients may be any\nreal numbers.\n\n\nPolynomial is an\u00a0expression in the following form:\n\n\nP(n) = aD.nD+aD-1.nD-1+...+a1.n+a0\n\n\n\nIf aD <> 0, the number D is called a\u00a0degree of the polynomial.

The main hero has a puzzle that takes a very important role in the\nplay and gives an opportunity of many improvisations.\n\nThe puzzle is the worldwide known Lloyd's Fifteen Puzzle. ACM wants\nto make the play more interesting so they want to replace the\n\"standard\" puzzle with a three-dimensional one. The puzzle consists\nof a cube containing M3 slots. Each slot except one\ncontains a cubic tile (one position is free).\nThe tiles are numbered from 1 to M3-1.\nThe goal of the puzzle is to get the original ordering of\nthe tiles after they have been randomly reshuffled.  The only allowed\nmoves are sliding a neighbouring tile into the free position along one\nof the three principal directions. Original configuration is when slot\nwith coordinates (x,y,z) from {0,...,M-1}3\ncontains tile number z.M2+y.M+x+1 and slot\n(M-1,M-1,M-1) is free.\n\nYou are to write a program to determine whether it is possible \nto solve the puzzle or not.\n\n\nInput\nThe input consists of N cases.

You can see it\nmight be very interesting to play the commedia dell' arte. Therefore\nthe ACM want to put a new play on a stage, which was completely unknown\nbefore. The main hero has a puzzle that takes a very important role in the\nplay and gives an opportunity of many improvisations.\n\nThe puzzle is the worldwide known Lloyd's Fifteen Puzzle. ACM wants\nto make the play more interesting so they want to replace the\n\"standard\" puzzle with a three-dimensional one. The puzzle consists\nof a cube containing M3 slots. Each slot except one\ncontains a cubic tile (one position is free).\nThe tiles are numbered from 1 to M3-1.\nThe goal of the puzzle is to get the original ordering of\nthe tiles after they have been randomly reshuffled.  The only allowed\nmoves are sliding a neighbouring tile into the free position along one\nof the three principal directions. Original configuration is when slot\nwith coordinates (x,y,z) from {0,...,M-1}3\ncontains tile number z.M2+y.M+x+1 and slot\n(M-1,M-1,M-1) is free.\n\nYou are to write a program to determine whether it is possible \nto solve the puzzle or not.\n\n"

After some intensive studies, he has decided upon the Vigen\u010f\u017c\u02ddre cipher. Messages written using 26 upper case characters of the Latin alphabet: A, B, ..., Z which are interpreted as integers 0,1, ..., 25 respectively. The secret cypher for transmitting a message is known to both sides and consists of n integers k1, k2,...,kn. Using this cypher, the i-th number xi of the input message x is encrypted to the form of the i-th number of the output message y, as follows:yi =(xi+k1+ ((i-1) mod n)) mod 26.\n\nYou are trying to find out the content of a message transmitted by the BBFO. By a lucky stroke of fortune, your spies managed to intercept the message in both its plaintext and encrypted form (x and y respectively). Unfortunately, during their dramatic escape the files they were carrying where pierced by bullets and fragments of messages x and y were inadvertently lost. Or were they? It is your task to reconstruct as much of message x as you possibly can.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains a single integer t<=200 denoting the number of test cases. t test case descriptions follow.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains one integer m which is some upper bound on the length of the cypher (1<=n<=m<=100000).

    "Description": "\nThe Bytelandian Cryptographer has been requested by the BBFO to put forward an encryption scheme which would allow the BBFO to communicate with its foreign associates. After some intensive studies, he has decided upon the Vigen\u010f\u017c\u02ddre cipher. Messages written using 26 upper case characters of the Latin alphabet: A, B, ..., Z which are interpreted as integers 0,1, ..., 25 respectively. The secret cypher for transmitting a message is known to both sides and consists of n integers k1, k2,...,kn. Using this cypher, the i-th number xi of the input message x is encrypted to the form of the i-th number of the output message y, as follows:yi =(xi+k1+ ((i-1) mod n)) mod 26.\n\nYou are trying to find out the content of a message transmitted by the BBFO. By a lucky stroke of fortune, your spies managed to intercept the message in both its plaintext and encrypted form (x and y respectively). Unfortunately, during their dramatic escape the files they were carrying where pierced by bullets and fragments of messages x and y were inadvertently lost. Or were they? It is your task to reconstruct as much of message x as you possibly can.\n"

Moreover,\nafter the Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) are built and\nworking, we need to perform many various measurements to determine the state\nof the network, and propose effective improvements to be made.\n\n\n\nThe ACM technicians have a\u00a0special equipment for measuring the strength of\nelectro-magnetic fields, the transceivers' power and quality of the signal.\nThis equipment is packed into a\u00a0huge knapsack and the technician must move\nwith it from one BTS to another. Unfortunately, the knapsack have not enough\nmemory for storing all of the measured values. It has a\u00a0small cache only,\nthat can store values for several seconds. Then the values must be\ntransmitted to the BTS by an\u00a0infrared connection (IRDA). The IRDA needs\ndirect visibility between the technician and the BTS.\n\n\nYour task is to find the path between two neighbouring BTSes such that at\nleast one of those BTSes is always visible.\n\n\nInput\n\nThere is a\u00a0single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 500). It stands\nfor the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of a\u00a0town\ndescription. For simplicity, a\u00a0town is modelled as a\u00a0rectangular grid of\n\nP x Q square fields. Each field is exactly 1\u00a0metre wide. For each\nfield, a\u00a0non-negative integer Zi,j is given, representing the height of\nthe terrain in that place, in metres. That means the town model is made of\ncubes, each of them being either solid or empty. There are no \"half solid\"\ncubes.\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integer numbers P and Q,\nseparated by a\u00a0single space, \n1 <= P,Q <= 200. Then there are P lines\neach containing Q integer numbers separated by a\u00a0space. These numbers are\n\nZi,j, where \n1 <= i <= P, \n1 <= j <= Q and\n\n0 <= Zi,j <= 5000. After the terrain\ndescription, there are four numbers \n\nR1, C1, R2, C2 on the last line of\neach test case. These numbers represent position of two\nBTSes, \n1 <= R1,R2 <= P, \n1 <= C1,C2 <= Q. The first coordinate\n(R) determines the row of the town, the second coordinate determines the\ncolumn.\n\n\n\nThe technician is moving in steps (steps stands for\nStandard Technician's Elementary Positional Shift). Each step is made\nbetween two neighbouring square fields. That means the step is always in\nNorth, South, West or East direction. It is not possible to move diagonally.\nThe step between two fields A and B (step from A to B) is allowed\nonly if the height of the terrain in the field B is not very different from\nthe height in the field A. The technician can climb at most 1\u00a0metre up or\ndescend at most 3\u00a0metres down in a\u00a0single step.\n\n\n\nAt the end of each step, at least one of the two BTSes must be visible.\nHowever, there can be some point \"in the middle of the step\" where no BTS\nis visible. This is OK and the data is handled by the cache. The BTS is\nconsidered visible, if there is a\u00a0direct visibility between the unit cube\njust above the terrain on the BTSes coordinates and the cube just above the\nterrain on the square field, where the technician is. Direct visibility\nbetween two cubes means that the line connecting the centres of the two cubes\ndoes not intersect any solid cube. However, the line can touch any number of\nsolid cubes. In other words, consider both the BTS and the technician being\npoints exactly half metre above the surface and in the centre of the\nappropriate square field.\n\n\nNote that the IRDA beam can go between two cubes that touch each other by\ntheir edge, although there is no space between them. It is because such\na\u00a0beam touches both of these two cubes but does not intersect any of\nthem. See the last test case of the sample input for an\u00a0example of such\na\u00a0situation.\n\n\nOutput\n\nYou are to find the shortest possible path from BTS (R1, C1) to BTS (R2, C2), meeting the above criteria. All\nsteps must be done between neighbouring fields, the terrain must not elevate\nor descend too much, and at the end of each step, at least one BTS must be\nvisible.\n\n\nFor each test case, print one line containing the sentence\nThe shortest path is M steps long., where M is the number of\nsteps that must be made. If there is no such path, output the sentence\n\nMission impossible!.\n\nExample\nSample Input:\n4\n5 5\n8 7 6 5 4\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 1 5 1\n5 8\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 5 1\n5 8\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n1 5 5 1\n6 12\n5 5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n5 5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n5 5 5 5 9 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n5 9 1 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n5 5 9 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n5 5 9 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n6 1 3 12\n\nSample Output:\nThe shortest path is 10 steps long.\nMission impossible!\nThe shortest path is 14 steps long.\nThe shortest path is 18 steps long.\n\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkumar gaurav: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2015-10-06 10:53:34\n\ncan we use cache for only one movement?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRafail Loizou: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2015-03-25 16:19:54\n\nstill can not figure out how to test visibility\ndo i need to make use of advanced computational geometry skills?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMayank Raj: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2013-09-01 21:21:57\n\nDijkshtra getting timed out in java :'( \ndo i need to do a fib heap implementation??? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABHISHEK: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2013-05-26 21:04:27\n\nhow to check the condition if technician is directly visible from any of the two BTS?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntantrum: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2013-05-22 15:29:09\n\nwill bfs work for this??\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nahmed abd alrhman mohamed: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2013-01-31 03:20:37\n\nyes i do it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiovanni Botta: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2013-01-10 20:20:41\n\nHow about Dijkstra's algorithm?\n\nEdit: Actually it's a little more complicated than that...\nLast edit: 2013-01-10 20:34:47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Polaczanski: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2011-06-04 14:40:24\n\nAny hint to solve this problem?\nI made my solution, bu it is to slow.\nI compute the linear function and I compute whether is there anything higher between the operator and any source light \nLast edit: 2011-06-04 14:42:05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by:adrian\nDate:2004-05-08\nTime limit:13s\n\t\t\t\nSource limit:50000B\nMemory limit:1536MB\n\nCluster:\n\nCube (Intel G860)\n\n\nLanguages:All except: NODEJS PERL6 VB.NET \nResource:ACM Central European Programming Contest, Prague 2000 \n",

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEQBOX - Equipment Box\n\n\n#plane-geometry\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a large room in the Pyramid called Room-of-No-Return. Its\nfloor is covered by rectangular tiles of equal size. The name of the room\nwas chosen because of the very high number of traps and mechanisms in it.\nThe ACM group has spent several years studying the secret plan of this room.\nIt has made a clever plan to avoid all the traps. A specially trained\nmechanic was sent to deactivate the most feared trap called Shattered Bones.\nAfter deactivating the trap the mechanic had to escape from the room.\nIt is very important to step on the center of the tiles only; he must\nnot touch the edges. One wrong step and a large rock \nfalls from the ceiling squashing the mechanic like a pancake. After deactivating\nthe trap, he realized a horrible thing: the ACM plan did not take his\nequipment box into consideration. The box must be laid onto the\nground because the mechanic must have both hands free to prevent contact with\nother traps. But when the box is laid on the ground, it could touch the line\nseparating the tiles. And this is the main problem you are to solve.\n\nInput\n\nThe input consists of T test cases (T is equal to about 10000). The number of them (T) is given on\nthe first line of the input file.\nEach test case consists of a single line. The line contains exactly four\ninteger numbers separated by spaces: A, B,\nX and Y. A and Bindicate the\ndimensions of the tiles, X and Y are the dimensions of\nthe equipment box (1 <= A,B,X,Y <= 50000).\n\nOutput\nYour task is to determine whether it is possible to put the box on \na\u00a0single tile -- that is, if the whole box fits on a\u00a0single tile without\ntouching its border. If so, you are to print one line with the\nsentence \"Escape is possible.\".

    "Description": "\n\nThere is a large room in the Pyramid called Room-of-No-Return. Its\nfloor is covered by rectangular tiles of equal size. The name of the room\nwas chosen because of the very high number of traps and mechanisms in it.\nThe ACM group has spent several years studying the secret plan of this room.\nIt has made a clever plan to avoid all the traps. A specially trained\nmechanic was sent to deactivate the most feared trap called Shattered Bones.\nAfter deactivating the trap the mechanic had to escape from the room.\nIt is very important to step on the center of the tiles only; he must\nnot touch the edges. One wrong step and a large rock \nfalls from the ceiling squashing the mechanic like a pancake. After deactivating\nthe trap, he realized a horrible thing: the ACM plan did not take his\nequipment box into consideration. The box must be laid onto the\nground because the mechanic must have both hands free to prevent contact with\nother traps. But when the box is laid on the ground, it could touch the line\nseparating the tiles. And this is the main problem you are to solve.\n"

Therefore,\nhotline service is very important for every company. We need a\u00a0single phone\nnumber where the customer can always find a\u00a0friendly voice ready to help with\nanything. On the other hand, many people are needed to serve as hotline\noperators, and human resources are always very expensive. Moreover, it is not\neasy to pretend \"friendly voice\" at 4am and explain to a\u00a0drunken man that you\nare really unable to give him the number to House of Parliament. It was\nalso found that some of the questions repeat very often and it is very\nannoying to answer them again and again.\n\n\nACM is a\u00a0modern company, wanting to solve its hotline problem. They want\nto decrease the number of human operators by creating a\u00a0complex software\nsystem that would be able to answer most common questions. The customer's\nvoice is analysed by a\u00a0special Voice Recognition Module (VRM) and converted\nto a\u00a0plain text. The text is then taken by an Artificial Automatic Adaptive\nAnswering Algorithm (AAAAA). The most common questions are recognised and\nanswered automatically. The replies are then converted to a\u00a0sound by\nText-to-Speech Module (TTS).\n\n\nYou are to write the AAAAA module. Because your algorithm should be adaptive,\nit has no explicit knowledge base. But it must be able to listen to sentences\nin English and remember the mentioned facts. Whenever the question is asked\nabout such a\u00a0fact, the system has to answer it properly. The VRM and TTS\nmodules are already implemented, so the input and output of AAAAA will be in\nthe text form.\n\n\nInput\n\nThere is a\u00a0single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands\nfor the number of dialogues to follow. Each dialogue consists of zero or more\nlines, each of them containing one sentence: either statement or question. The\nstatement ends with a\u00a0dot character (.), the question ends with\na\u00a0question mark (?). No statement will appear more than once, however\nthe questions can be repeated. There is one extra line after each dialogue.\nThat line ends with an\u00a0exclamation mark (!).\n\n\nSentences can contain words, spaces and punctuation characters (such as\ncommas, colons, semicolons etc.). All words contain only letters of English\nalphabet and are case-sensitive. That means the same word is always written\nthe same way, usually in lowercase. Acronyms, names and some other words can\nbegin with capital letters. For simplicity, all sentences begin with\na\u00a0lowercase letter. Only if the first word should be written with a\u00a0capital,\nthe sentence begins with a\u00a0capital letter. There are no unneeded spaces\nbetween words. No line will have more than 100 characters. There will be at\nmost 100 statements per each test case.\n\n\nStatements\n\nEach statement has one of the following two forms ( _ denotes a\u00a0space):\n\nsubject  _predicate[s] [ _object] .\n\nsubject  _don't|doesn't  _predicate [ _object] .\n\nThe square brackets mark an\u00a0optional part, the vertical line two possible\nvariants. Subject is a\u00a0single word, noun or pronoun in singular. Predicate is\na\u00a0verb (single word) denoting some activity. Object can be any text. Object\ndoes not contain any dots. Any pair \"verb + object\" determines unique\nactivity. The same verb with different objects makes different independent\nactivities, i.e. the different and independent meaning of the sentence.\nSentence without any object can be considered as sentence with an\u00a0empty\nobject. The verb without an\u00a0object has different and independent meaning than\nthe same verb with any non-empty object.\n\n\nThe first variant of sentence denotes a\u00a0positive statement. The word\n\"predicate[s]\" means verb that matches the subject of the sentence.\nIf the subject is \"I\" or \"you\", the verb has the same form as the\ninfinitive. With any other subject, the letter \"s\" is appended on the\nend of the verb. Assume there are no irregular verbs.\n\n\nThe second variant is a\u00a0negative statement. Verb \"don't\" or\n\"doesn't\" must also match the subject. The form \"don't\" is used\nwith either \"I\" or \"you\", \"doesn't\" is used in any other\ncase.\n\n\nA\u00a0special generic subject \"everybody\" can be used. It means the activity\nholds for any subject. Other special subject is \"nobody\". Such sentence\nalso holds for any subject, but its meaning is negative. Both of these generic\nsubjects can be used with the first variant only (without \"doesn't\").\nThe sentence \"nobody likes something\" is exactly equal to\n\"everybody doesn't like something\", except the latter form will never\noccur in the input.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nEach question has one of the following three forms:\n\n\n1.\ndo|does  _subject  _predicate [ _object] ?\n2.\nwho  _predicates [ _object] ?\n3.\nwhat  _do|does  _subject do ?\n\n\n\nThe word \"do|does\" always matches the subject (\"do I?\",\n\"do you?\", \"does any other subject?\"). In the second\ntype of question, predicate always matches the word \"who\", i.e. the\n\"s\" is always appended. Generic subjects cannot be used in questions.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each dialogue, your program must output the line Dialogue #D:,\nwhere D is the sequence number of dialogue, starting with 1. Then print\nexactly three lines for every question: the first line repeats the question,\nthe second line contains the answer, and the third line is empty. Print\nnothing for statements. After each dialogue, print the same line with\nan\u00a0exclamation mark that was in the input. Then print one extra empty line.\nEmpty line contains a\u00a0new-line character only.\n\n\nThe answer must be properly formated to be accepted by a\u00a0TTS module. Only the\nstatements appearing in the input before the answer are used for the\ncorresponding reply. If there is any contradiction among statements, the\nreply is always I am abroad.. If the question and statements consider\nthe special subject \"you\", it must be replaced with \"I\" in the\nanswer.

    "Input": "\nThere is a\u00a0single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands\nfor the number of dialogues to follow. Each dialogue consists of zero or more\nlines, each of them containing one sentence: either statement or question. The\nstatement ends with a\u00a0dot character (.), the question ends with\na\u00a0question mark (?). No statement will appear more than once, however\nthe questions can be repeated. There is one extra line after each dialogue.\nThat line ends with an\u00a0exclamation mark (!).\n\n\nSentences can contain words, spaces and punctuation characters (such as\ncommas, colons, semicolons etc.). All words contain only letters of English\nalphabet and are case-sensitive. That means the same word is always written\nthe same way, usually in lowercase. Acronyms, names and some other words can\nbegin with capital letters. For simplicity, all sentences begin with\na\u00a0lowercase letter. Only if the first word should be written with a\u00a0capital,\nthe sentence begins with a\u00a0capital letter. There are no unneeded spaces\nbetween words. No line will have more than 100 characters. There will be at\nmost 100 statements per each test case.\n\n\nStatements\n\nEach statement has one of the following two forms ( _ denotes a\u00a0space):\n\nsubject  _predicate[s] [ _object] .\n\nsubject  _don't|doesn't  _predicate [ _object] .\n\nThe square brackets mark an\u00a0optional part, the vertical line two possible\nvariants. Subject is a\u00a0single word, noun or pronoun in singular. Predicate is\na\u00a0verb (single word) denoting some activity. Object can be any text. Object\ndoes not contain any dots. Any pair \"verb + object\" determines unique\nactivity. The same verb with different objects makes different independent\nactivities, i.e. the different and independent meaning of the sentence.\nSentence without any object can be considered as sentence with an\u00a0empty\nobject. The verb without an\u00a0object has different and independent meaning than\nthe same verb with any non-empty object.\n\n\nThe first variant of sentence denotes a\u00a0positive statement. The word\n\"predicate[s]\" means verb that matches the subject of the sentence.\nIf the subject is \"I\" or \"you\", the verb has the same form as the\ninfinitive. With any other subject, the letter \"s\" is appended on the\nend of the verb. Assume there are no irregular verbs.\n\n\nThe second variant is a\u00a0negative statement. Verb \"don't\" or\n\"doesn't\" must also match the subject. The form \"don't\" is used\nwith either \"I\" or \"you\", \"doesn't\" is used in any other\ncase.\n\n\nA\u00a0special generic subject \"everybody\" can be used. It means the activity\nholds for any subject. Other special subject is \"nobody\". Such sentence\nalso holds for any subject, but its meaning is negative. Both of these generic\nsubjects can be used with the first variant only (without \"doesn't\").\nThe sentence \"nobody likes something\" is exactly equal to\n\"everybody doesn't like something\", except the latter form will never\noccur in the input.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nEach question has one of the following three forms:\n\n\n1.\ndo|does  _subject  _predicate [ _object] ?\n2.\nwho  _predicates [ _object] ?\n3.\nwhat  _do|does  _subject do ?\n\n\n\nThe word \"do|does\" always matches the subject (\"do I?\",\n\"do you?\", \"does any other subject?\"). In the second\ntype of question, predicate always matches the word \"who\", i.e. the\n\"s\" is always appended. Generic subjects cannot be used in questions.\n\n",
    "Description": "\n\nEvery customer sometimes needs help with new and unusual products. Therefore,\nhotline service is very important for every company. We need a\u00a0single phone\nnumber where the customer can always find a\u00a0friendly voice ready to help with\nanything. On the other hand, many people are needed to serve as hotline\noperators, and human resources are always very expensive. Moreover, it is not\neasy to pretend \"friendly voice\" at 4am and explain to a\u00a0drunken man that you\nare really unable to give him the number to House of Parliament. It was\nalso found that some of the questions repeat very often and it is very\nannoying to answer them again and again.\n\n\nACM is a\u00a0modern company, wanting to solve its hotline problem. They want\nto decrease the number of human operators by creating a\u00a0complex software\nsystem that would be able to answer most common questions. The customer's\nvoice is analysed by a\u00a0special Voice Recognition Module (VRM) and converted\nto a\u00a0plain text. The text is then taken by an Artificial Automatic Adaptive\nAnswering Algorithm (AAAAA). The most common questions are recognised and\nanswered automatically. The replies are then converted to a\u00a0sound by\nText-to-Speech Module (TTS).\n\n\nYou are to write the AAAAA module. Because your algorithm should be adaptive,\nit has no explicit knowledge base. But it must be able to listen to sentences\nin English and remember the mentioned facts. Whenever the question is asked\nabout such a\u00a0fact, the system has to answer it properly. The VRM and TTS\nmodules are already implemented, so the input and output of AAAAA will be in\nthe text form.\n\n"

It is sometimes very annoying to write longer messages,\nbecause one key must be usually pressed several times to produce a\u00a0single\nletter. It is due to a\u00a0low number of keys on the keypad. Typical phone has\ntwelve keys only (and maybe some other control keys that are not used for\ntyping). Moreover, only eight keys are used for typing 26\u00a0letters of\nan\u00a0English alphabet. The standard assignment of letters on the keypad is\nshown in the left picture:\n\n\n\n\n1\u00a0\n2abc\n3def\n\n4ghi\n5jkl\n6mno\n\n7pqrs\n8tuv\n9wxyz\n\n*\u00a0\n0space\n#\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1\u00a0\n2abcd\n3efg\n\n4hijk\n5lm\n6nopq\n\n7rs\n8tuv\n9wxyz\n\n*\u00a0\n0space\n#\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 3 or 4 letters assigned to each key. If you want the first letter\nof any group, you press that key once. If you want the second letter, you\nhave to press the key twice. For other letters, the key must be pressed three\nor four times. The authors of the keyboard did not try to optimise the layout\nfor minimal number of keystrokes. Instead, they preferred the even\ndistribution of letters among the keys. Unfortunately, some letters are more\nfrequent than others. Some of these frequent letters are placed on the third\nor even fourth place on the standard keyboard. For\nexample, S is a\u00a0very common letter in an\u00a0English alphabet, and we need\nfour keystrokes to type it. If the assignment of characters was like in the\nright picture, the keyboard would be much more comfortable for typing average\nEnglish texts.\n\n\nACM have decided to put an\u00a0optimised version of the keyboard on its new\ncellular phone. Now they need a\u00a0computer program that will find an\u00a0optimal\nlayout for the given letter frequency. We need to preserve alphabetical\norder of letters, because the user would be confused if the letters were\nmixed. But we can assign any number of letters to a\u00a0single key.\n\n\nInput\n\nThere is a\u00a0single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 2000). It stands\nfor the number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a\u00a0line\ncontaining two integers K, L (1  <= K  <= L  <= 90) separated by\na\u00a0single space. K is the number of keys, L is the number of letters to be\nmapped onto those keys. Then there are two lines. The first\none contains exactly K characters each representing a\u00a0name of one\nkey. The second line contains exactly L characters representing names\nof letters of an\u00a0alphabet. Keys and letters are represented by digits,\nletters (which are case-sensitive), or any punctuation characters (ASCII code\nbetween 33 and 126 inclusively). No two keys have the same character, no two\nletters are the same. However, the name of a\u00a0letter can be used also as\na\u00a0name for a\u00a0key.\n\n\nAfter those two lines, there are exactly L lines each containing exactly\none positive integer F1, F2, ... FL. These numbers determine the\nfrequency of every letter, starting with the first one and continuing with\nthe others sequentially. The higher number means the more common letter. No\nfrequency will be higher than 100000.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFind an\u00a0optimal keyboard for each test case. Optimal keyboard is such that\nhas the lowest \"price\" for typing average text. The price is determined\nas the sum of the prices of each letter. The price of a\u00a0letter is a\u00a0product\nof the\u00a0letter frequency (Fi) and its position on the key. The order of\nletters cannot be changed, they must be grouped in the given order.\n\n\nIf there are more solutions with the same price, we will try to maximise the\nnumber of letters assigned to the last key, then to the one before the last\none etc.\n\n\nMore formally, you are to find a\u00a0sequence P1, P2, ... PL \nrepresenting the position of every letter on a\u00a0particular key. The sequence\nmust meet following conditions:\n\n\nP1 = 1\nfor each i>1, either \nPi = Pi-1+1 or Pi = 1\nthere are at most K numbers Pi such that Pi = 1\nthe sum of products SP = \nSum[i=1..l]\nFi.Pi is minimal\nfor any other sequence Q meeting these criteria and with the same\n  sum SQ = SP, there exists such M, \n1 <= M <= L that for any J,\n  M<J <= L, PJ = QJ, and PM>QM.\n\n\n\nThe output for every test case must start with a\u00a0single line saying\nKeypad #I:, where I is a\u00a0sequential order of the test case,\nstarting with 1. Then there must be exactly K lines, each representing one\nletter, in the same order that was used in input. Each line must contain the\ncharacter representing the key, a\u00a0colon, one space and a\u00a0list of letters\nassigned to that particular key.

    "Output": "\nFind an\u00a0optimal keyboard for each test case. Optimal keyboard is such that\nhas the lowest \"price\" for typing average text. The price is determined\nas the sum of the prices of each letter. The price of a\u00a0letter is a\u00a0product\nof the\u00a0letter frequency (Fi) and its position on the key. The order of\nletters cannot be changed, they must be grouped in the given order.\n\n\nIf there are more solutions with the same price, we will try to maximise the\nnumber of letters assigned to the last key, then to the one before the last\none etc.\n\n\nMore formally, you are to find a\u00a0sequence P1, P2, ... PL \nrepresenting the position of every letter on a\u00a0particular key. The sequence\nmust meet following conditions:\n\n\nP1 = 1\nfor each i>1, either \nPi = Pi-1+1 or Pi = 1\nthere are at most K numbers Pi such that Pi = 1\nthe sum of products SP = \nSum[i=1..l]\nFi.Pi is minimal\nfor any other sequence Q meeting these criteria and with the same\n  sum SQ = SP, there exists such M, \n1 <= M <= L that for any J,\n  M<J <= L, PJ = QJ, and PM>QM.\n\n\n\nThe output for every test case must start with a\u00a0single line saying\nKeypad #I:, where I is a\u00a0sequential order of the test case,\nstarting with 1. Then there must be exactly K lines, each representing one\nletter, in the same order that was used in input. Each line must contain the\ncharacter representing the key, a\u00a0colon, one space and a\u00a0list of letters\nassigned to that particular key. Letters are not separated from each other.\n\n\nPrint one blank line after each test case, including the last one.\n\n",
    "Input": "\nThere is a\u00a0single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 2000). It stands\nfor the number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a\u00a0line\ncontaining two integers K, L (1  <= K  <= L  <= 90) separated by\na\u00a0single space. K is the number of keys, L is the number of letters to be\nmapped onto those keys. Then there are two lines. The first\none contains exactly K characters each representing a\u00a0name of one\nkey. The second line contains exactly L characters representing names\nof letters of an\u00a0alphabet. Keys and letters are represented by digits,\nletters (which are case-sensitive), or any punctuation characters (ASCII code\nbetween 33 and 126 inclusively). No two keys have the same character, no two\nletters are the same. However, the name of a\u00a0letter can be used also as\na\u00a0name for a\u00a0key.\n\n\nAfter those two lines, there are exactly L lines each containing exactly\none positive integer F1, F2, ... FL. These numbers determine the\nfrequency of every letter, starting with the first one and continuing with\nthe others sequentially. The higher number means the more common letter. No\nfrequency will be higher than 100000.\n\n",
    "Description": "\n\nMost of you have probably tried to type an\u00a0SMS message on the keypad of\na\u00a0cellular phone. It is sometimes very annoying to write longer messages,\nbecause one key must be usually pressed several times to produce a\u00a0single\nletter. It is due to a\u00a0low number of keys on the keypad. Typical phone has\ntwelve keys only (and maybe some other control keys that are not used for\ntyping). Moreover, only eight keys are used for typing 26\u00a0letters of\nan\u00a0English alphabet. The standard assignment of letters on the keypad is\nshown in the left picture:\n\n\n\n\n1\u00a0\n2abc\n3def\n\n4ghi\n5jkl\n6mno\n\n7pqrs\n8tuv\n9wxyz\n\n*\u00a0\n0space\n#\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1\u00a0\n2abcd\n3efg\n\n4hijk\n5lm\n6nopq\n\n7rs\n8tuv\n9wxyz\n\n*\u00a0\n0space\n#\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 3 or 4 letters assigned to each key. If you want the first letter\nof any group, you press that key once. If you want the second letter, you\nhave to press the key twice. For other letters, the key must be pressed three\nor four times. The authors of the keyboard did not try to optimise the layout\nfor minimal number of keystrokes. Instead, they preferred the even\ndistribution of letters among the keys. Unfortunately, some letters are more\nfrequent than others. Some of these frequent letters are placed on the third\nor even fourth place on the standard keyboard. For\nexample, S is a\u00a0very common letter in an\u00a0English alphabet, and we need\nfour keystrokes to type it. If the assignment of characters was like in the\nright picture, the keyboard would be much more comfortable for typing average\nEnglish texts.\n\n\nACM have decided to put an\u00a0optimised version of the keyboard on its new\ncellular phone. Now they need a\u00a0computer program that will find an\u00a0optimal\nlayout for the given letter frequency. We need to preserve alphabetical\norder of letters, because the user would be confused if the letters were\nmixed. But we can assign any number of letters to a\u00a0single key.\n\n"

The labyrinth is divided into square blocks, each of them either filled by rock, or free. There is also a little hook on the floor in the center of every free block. The ACM have found that two of the hooks must be connected by a rope that runs through the hooks in every block on the path between the connected ones. When the rope is fastened, a secret door opens. The problem is that we do not know which hooks to connect. That means also that the neccessary length of the rope is unknown. Your task is to determine the maximum length of the rope we could need for a given labyrinth.\nInput\nThe input consists of T test cases. The number of them (T) is given on the first line of the input file.\nEach test case begins with a line containing two integers C and R (3 <= C,R <= 1000) indicating the number of columns and rows. Then exactly R lines follow, each containing C characters. These characters specify the labyrinth. Each of them is either a hash mark (#) or a period (.). Hash marks represent rocks, periods are free blocks. It is possible to walk between neighbouring blocks only, where neighbouring blocks are blocks sharing a\u00a0common side. We cannot walk diagonally and we cannot step out of the labyrinth. \n\n\nThe labyrinth is designed in such a way that there is exactly one path between any two free blocks. Consequently, if we find the proper hooks to connect, it is easy to find the right path connecting them.\n\nOutput\nYour program must print exactly one line of output for each test case. The line must contain the sentence \"Maximum rope length is X.\" where Xis the length of the longest path between any two free blocks, measured in blocks.\n\nExample\nSample Input:\n2\n3 3\n###\n#.#\n###\n7 6\n#######\n#.#.###\n#.#.###\n#.#.#.#\n#.....#\n#######\n\nSample output:\nMaximum rope length is 0.\nMaximum rope length is 8.\nWarning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n<\nPrevious\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nNext\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhello_world123: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2018-06-13 16:22:03\n\nCan be done using only DFS .....

One of the most important things is also the list of games the\nphone provides. Nokia is one of the most successful phone makers because of\nits famous Snake and Snake\u00a0II. ACM wants to make and sell its own phone and\nthey need to program several games for it. One of them is Master-Mind, the\nfamous board logical game.\n\n\nThe game is played between two players. One of them chooses a\u00a0secret code\nconsisting of P\u00a0ordered pins, each of them having one of the predefined set of\nC\u00a0colours. The goal of the second player is to guess that secret sequence of\ncolours. Some colours may not appear in the code, some colours may appear more\nthan once.\n\n\nThe player makes guesses, which are formed in the same way as the secret\ncode. After each guess, he/she is provided with an\u00a0information on how\nsuccessful the guess was. This feedback is called a\u00a0hint. Each hint\nconsists of B black points and W white points. The black point stands for\nevery pin that was guessed right, i.e. the right colour was put on the right\nposition. The white point means right colour but on the wrong position. For\nexample, if the secret code is \"white, yellow, red, blue, white\" and the\nguess was \"white, red, white, white, blue\", the hint would consist of one\nblack point (for the white on the first position) and three white points\n(for the other white, red and blue colours). The goal is to guess the\nsequence with the minimal number of hints.\n\n\nThe new ACM phone should have the possibility to play both roles. It can make\nthe secret code and give hints, but it can also make its own guesses. Your\ngoal is to write a\u00a0program for the latter case, that means a\u00a0program that\nmakes Master-Mind guesses.\n\n\nInput\n\nThere is a\u00a0single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands\nfor the number of test cases to follow. Each test case describes one game\nsituation and you are to make a\u00a0guess.

P (\n1 <= P <= 10) is\nthe number of pins, C (1 <= C <= 100) is the number of colours, and M \n(1 <= M <= 100) is the number of already played guesses.\n\n\nThen there are 2 x M lines, two lines for every guess. At the first line of\neach guess, there are P integer numbers representing colours of the guess.\nEach colour is represented by a\u00a0number Gi, \n1 <= Gi <= C.

This is often referred to as finding a needle in a haystack.\nThe program has to detect all occurences of the needle in the haystack. It should take the needle and the haystack as input, and output the positions of each occurence, as shown below.\nThe suggested implementation is the KMP algorithm, but this is not a requirement. However, a naive approach will probably exceed the time limit, whereas other algorithms are more complicated... The choice is yours.\nInput\nThe input consists of a number of test cases. Each test case is composed of three lines, containing:\n\n\nthe length of the needle,\nthe needle itself,\nthe haystack.\n\n\nThe length of the needle is only limited by the memory available to your program, so do not make any assumptions - instead, read the length and allocate memory as needed. The haystack is not limited in size, which implies that your program should not read the whole haystack at once. The KMP algorithm is stream-based, i.e. it processes the haystack character by character, so this is not a problem.\nThe test cases come one after another, each occupying three lines, with no additional space or line breaks in between.\nOutput\nFor each test case your program should output all positions of the needle's occurences within the haystack.

    "Output": "For each test case your program should output all positions of the needle's occurences within the haystack. If a match is found, the output should contain the position of the first character of the match. Characters in the haystack are numbered starting with zero.\nFor a given test case, the positions output should be sorted in ascending order, and each of these should be printed in a separate line. For two different test cases, the positions should be separated by an empty line.",
    "Input": "The input consists of a number of test cases. Each test case is composed of three lines, containing:\n\n\nthe length of the needle,\nthe needle itself,\nthe haystack.\n\n\nThe length of the needle is only limited by the memory available to your program, so do not make any assumptions - instead, read the length and allocate memory as needed. The haystack is not limited in size, which implies that your program should not read the whole haystack at once. The KMP algorithm is stream-based, i.e. it processes the haystack character by character, so this is not a problem.\nThe test cases come one after another, each occupying three lines, with no additional space or line breaks in between.",
    "Description": "\n\nWrite a program that finds all occurences of a given pattern in a given input string. This is often referred to as finding a needle in a haystack.\nThe program has to detect all occurences of the needle in the haystack. It should take the needle and the haystack as input, and output the positions of each occurence, as shown below.\nThe suggested implementation is the KMP algorithm, but this is not a requirement. However, a naive approach will probably exceed the time limit, whereas other algorithms are more complicated... The choice is yours."

But that\nis not the whole truth. The idea of the game is very old -- even the Egyptians had\nsomething similar. But they did not use it as a game. Instead, it was used as\na\u00a0very complicated lock. The lock was made of wood and consisted of a large\nnumber of square fields, laid out in regular rows and columns. Each field was\neither completely filled with wood, or empty. The key for this lock was\ntwo-dimensional and it was made by joining square parts of the same size\nas the fields of the lock. So they had a 2D lock and 2D key that could be\ninserted into the lock from the top. The key was designed so that it was\nnot possible to move it upwards. It could only fall down and it could\nslide sideways -- exactly like in a Tetris game. The only difference is\nthat the key could not be rotated.

Your program should be able to\ndetermine how deep a given key can be inserted into a given lock.\n\nInput\nThe input consists of T test cases. The number of them (T) is given on\nthe first line of the input file.\nEach test case begins with a line containing two integers R and C\n(1 <= R,C <= 100) indicating the key size.

A hash mark represents one square field made\nof wood; a period is an empty field. The wooden fields are always connected,\ni.e. the whole key is made of one piece.\nMoreover, the key remains connected even if we cut off arbitrary number of rows\nfrom its top. There is always at least one\nnon-empty field in the top-most and bottom-most rows and the left-most and\nright-most columns.\n\nAfter the key description, there is a line containing two integers D and W\n(1 <= D <= 10000,\n1 <= W <= 1000).

Your program should be able to\ndetermine how deep a given key can be inserted into a given lock.\n"

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCRAPER - Skyscraper Floors\n\n\nno tags\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nWhat a great idea it is to build skyscrapers! Using not too\nlarge area of land, which is very expensive in many cities today, the\nskyscrapers offer an extremely large utility area for flats or offices. \nThe only disadvantage is that it takes too long to get to the upper \nfloors. Of course these skyscrapers have to be equiped not only \nwith a stairway but also with several elevators. But even using \nordinary elevators is very slow. Just imagine you want to get from \nthe very top floor to the base floor and many other people on other \nfloors want the same. As a result the elevator stops on almost every \nfloor and since its capacity is limited and the elevator is already \nfull from the upper floors, most stops are useless and just cause \na delay. If there are more elevators in the skyscrapers, this problem \nis a little bit eliminated but still not completely. Most people just \npress all the buttons of all the elevators and then take the first \none so that all elevators will stop on the floor anyway.\n\nHowever, the solution exists as we shall see. The Antique Comedians of\nMidilesia headquarters reside in a skyscraper with a very special\nelevator system. The elevators do not stop on every floor but only on\nevery X-th floor.\nMoreover each elevator can go just to a certain floor Y\n(called starting floor) and cannot go any lower. There is one\nhigh-capacity elevator which can stop on every elevator's starting\nfloor.\n\nThe ACM has a big problem. The headquarters should be moved to\nanother office this week, possibly on a different floor. \nUnfortunately, the high-capacity elevator is\nout of order right now so it is not always possible to go to the base\nfloor. One piece of furniture cannot be moved using the stairway because it\nis too large to pass through the stairway door. You are to write\na program that decides whether it is possible to move a piece of\nfurniture from the original office to the other.\n\n\nInput\nThe input consists of N cases (equal to about 2000). The first line contains only\none positive integer N.

    "Description": "\nWhat a great idea it is to build skyscrapers! Using not too\nlarge area of land, which is very expensive in many cities today, the\nskyscrapers offer an extremely large utility area for flats or offices. \nThe only disadvantage is that it takes too long to get to the upper \nfloors. Of course these skyscrapers have to be equiped not only \nwith a stairway but also with several elevators. But even using \nordinary elevators is very slow. Just imagine you want to get from \nthe very top floor to the base floor and many other people on other \nfloors want the same. As a result the elevator stops on almost every \nfloor and since its capacity is limited and the elevator is already \nfull from the upper floors, most stops are useless and just cause \na delay. If there are more elevators in the skyscrapers, this problem \nis a little bit eliminated but still not completely. Most people just \npress all the buttons of all the elevators and then take the first \none so that all elevators will stop on the floor anyway.\n\nHowever, the solution exists as we shall see. The Antique Comedians of\nMidilesia headquarters reside in a skyscraper with a very special\nelevator system. The elevators do not stop on every floor but only on\nevery X-th floor.\nMoreover each elevator can go just to a certain floor Y\n(called starting floor) and cannot go any lower. There is one\nhigh-capacity elevator which can stop on every elevator's starting\nfloor.\n\nThe ACM has a big problem. The headquarters should be moved to\nanother office this week, possibly on a different floor. \nUnfortunately, the high-capacity elevator is\nout of order right now so it is not always possible to go to the base\nfloor. One piece of furniture cannot be moved using the stairway because it\nis too large to pass through the stairway door. You are to write\na program that decides whether it is possible to move a piece of\nfurniture from the original office to the other.\n\n"

When the stone is lifted up, a special mechanism detects this and activates poisoned arrows that are shot near the opening. The only possibility is to lift the stone very slowly and carefully. The ACM team must connect a rope to the stone and then lift it using a pulley. Moreover, the stone must be lifted all at once; no side can rise before another. So it is very important to find the centre of gravity and connect the rope\nexactly to that point. The stone has a polygonal shape and its height is the same throughout the whole polygonal area. Your task is to find the centre of gravity for the given polygon.\n\nInput\nThe input consists of T test cases (equal to about 500). The number of them (T) is given on the first line of the input file.\nEach test case begins with a line containing a single integer N (3 <= N <= 1000000) indicating the number of points that form the polygon. This is followed by N lines, each containing two integers Xi and Yi (|Xi|, |Yi| <= 20000). These numbers are the coordinates of the i-th point. When we connect the points in the given order, we get a polygon. You may assume that the edges never touch each other (except the neighbouring ones) and that they never cross.

A list may contain a city more than once. As they want to travel together, they have to agree upon a common route. No one wants to change the order of the cities on his list or add other cities. Therefore they have no choice but to remove some cities from the list. Of course the common route is to involve as much sight-seeing in cities as possible. There are exactly 26 cities in the region. Therefore they are encoded on the lists as lower case letters from 'a' to 'z'.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains a number T <= 10 that indicates the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of two lines; the first line is the list of Alice, the second line is the list of Bob. Each list consists of 1 to 80 lower case letters.\nOutput\nThe output for each test case should contain all different trips exactly once that meet the conditions described above. There is at least one such trip, but never more than 1000 different ones. You should order the trips in lexicographic order. Print one blank line between the output of different test cases.\nExample\nInput\n1\nabcabcaa\nacbacba\nOutput\nababa\nabaca\nabcba\nacaba\nacaca\nacbaa\nacbca\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n<\nPrevious\n1\n2\n3\nNext\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntanishkbansal: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2018-06-15 15:38:06\n\ni am not getting what we have to give in output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimes: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2018-05-24 18:14:18\n\nHey @imkiller, why do you keep posting links to your code after you solve a problem?

The allowed operations are XOR, NOT, AND, OR, and SHIFT, where the latter is the operation of shifting the bits of a number to the right or to the left (with digits disappearing or new zeroes appearing at one or the other end as needed). Note that in principle, NOT, AND, and OR are superfluous because they can be expressed in terms of XOR only. No automatic check will be performed on if the submitted code satisfies the aforementioned restrictions. This means that the problem solver needs to impose the restrictions on their code, keeping in mind the goal that we are trying to mimick how the CPU hardware handles integers.\nInput\nThe first number is the number of test cases, in binary.

Given two nonnegative integers A and B, the code should be able to decide whether A < B, A = B, or A > B, and to compute\n\nA + B,\u00a0\nA - B, with the convention that A - B = 0 for A < B,\u00a0\nA * B,\u00a0\nA / B (integer division)\nA % B (remainder).\u00a0\n\nMoeover, we introduce the new operation called truncated multiplication A # B [M], as follows. This operation will depend on the particular base in which the numbers are represented, and within the tests, it is assumed that the base is 100. In other words, we assume that any number A is represented within the code as\nA = A_0 + A_1 * BASE + A_2 * BASE^2 + ... , \nwhere 0 <= A_k < BASE are the digits, and we set BASE = 100 for the purposes of the tests. One can write the product A * B as\nA * B = A_0*B_0 + (A_0*B_1+A_1*B_0) * BASE + (A_0*B_2+A_1*B_1+A_2*B_0) * BASE^2 + ...\u00a0\nIf we remove the first M - 1 terms from this expansion, and divide the result by BASE^M, we get the truncated product A # B [M]. Note that truncated multiplication depends on a parameter M, which may be assumed to be a moderate sized integer (in particular well within the 32 bit range). For example, we have\n910 * 820 = (10+9*100)*(20+8*100) = 10*20 +\u00a0(10*8+9*20)*100 + (9*8)*100^2 = 200 + 260*100 + 72*100^2 = 746200\nand hence\n910 # 820 [M=1] = 260 + 72*100 = 7460\nand\n910 # 820 [M=2] = 72\nIf M is not too large, the digits of A # B [M] approximate the most significant digits of the product A * B well, so this operation can be used in multiplying mantissas of floating point numbers (Multiplying the mantissas exactly would result in too many digits, and a lot of them woud be meaningless anyway).\n\n\nInput\nAll numbers in input and output should be nonnegative integers in decimal notation. The first line of the input is the number N of test cases. Then each of the following N lines has either the format\nc A B\nor\nc A B M\nwhere c is one of the characters '<', '+', '-', '*', '#', '/', describing the arithmetic operation to be performed on the numbers A and B (and possibly M). The second format (and hence the number M) is used only when c = '#'. We emphasize again that in the tests we have, it is assumed that BASE = 100.\nOutput\nThe output should consist of N lines, with each line containing the result of the arithmetic operation in the corresponding line of the input.\n\nFor division, the output is 2 integers A / B and A % B, separated by a space. If B = 0, then return 0 0 (two zeroes).\nFor all other operations, the ouput is one integer.\nFor '<', the output should be 1 if A < B, 0 if A = B, and -1 if A > B.\nIn case of subtraction A - B with A < B, the ouput should be 0.\n\nExample\nInput:\n15\n< 1000 199915\n< 1000 1999\n< 9898 9898\n< 1234 123\n< 0 0\n+ 1791593436984766559642626609333245051871 307634751338542477034677711517175\n- 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 1\n- 9851454318615645743724544440468029862 40153566442954896526103872421591156\n* 333333333 0\n* 1 3333333335555\n* 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999 999999999999999999999999999999999999999\n/ 1 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999\n/ 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 2\n/ 861564574372454444046802986230763475133854247703 6442954896526103872421591156\n# 1010 2020 1\n# 619665458372652911688999608 5642672187122910629212227277 6\n\nOutput:\n\n1\n0\n-1\n0\n1791593744619517898185103644010956569046\n999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999\n9811300752172690847198440568046438706\n0\n3333333335555\n9999999999999999999999999999999999999989000000000000000000000000000000000000001\n0 1\n499999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 1\n133721962703322764598 5829723863328422309867552415\n20400\n3496569047280138337581751280571264068913704\n\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshivam_mnnit: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-05-09 21:45:15\n\nwhere to find the solution of the problems on spoj??\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsksugan02: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2016-10-27 14:37:23\n\nIf M is not too large, the digits of A # B [M] approximate the most significant digits of the product A * B well, so this operation can be used in multiplying mantissas of floating point numbers (Multiplying the mantissas exactly would result in too many digits, and a lot of them woud be meaningless anyway). \n\nCan someone please explain this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitch Schwartz: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2016-02-06 17:31:31\n\nNo mention of score.

I see. Nevermind!\n\nWait, WTF????? If you apply their transformation i+3%6, it doesn't get you the right answer... Some weird rollover (it rolls over back to 0 if i+3%6 > 6)\n\nThe question clearly states that taking the i+3%6th bit of the ith character will get you the right answer, but it's obviously not! If you simply apply that transformation, you'll QUICKLY overflow the array bounds, so there's obviously some sort of rollover, WHICH IS NOT DESCRIBED IN THE PROBLEM! For example, for i=6 (the last case in the example), if you simply applied the transformation you were told to use, you would get 6+3%6=9, WHICH OVERFLOWS THE BINARY ARRAY!\n\nYES GOT IT!!!! Problem is, I had to write a custom function map to actually MAP the value of the i+3%6 transformation to the correct array address, which is f(x) = x-6 if x>5, x otherwise (x is the value of i+3%6)... TBH, not a very well written problem, it didn't describe or even mention the rollover. aah well...\nLast edit: 2018-05-06 21:57:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nndrewxie: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2018-05-06 20:37:53\n\n\nLast edit: 2018-05-06 20:39:11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nndrewxie: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2018-05-06 20:34:51\n\n?\nI know how to get the first 2 characters, but what about the next ones?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstoneark: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-11-27 10:15:46\n\nAttention: \"Successive test cases are separated by an empty line.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nw4ff3l: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-10-16 20:55:05\n\nFirst try, this was a good lesson!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlove_god: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-10-12 12:38:39\n\nplz someone explain it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkejriwal_pk: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-07-26 09:42:10\n\nOnce you understand the question, its easy.

Each road has some blocks were damaged, so vehicles cannot move on these blocks. To ensure the traffic network is connected, they need to repair those roads. For each road, to repair 1 block, they need 1 unit of money. So if a road has M blocks are damaged, then they need M unit of money. However, too many roads were damaged, they only have K unit of money to repair a specific road. Then with K unit of money, they wish to repair the road such that the number of consecutive blocks that vehicles can move on is maximum.\nFor example, the following is a road with 11 blocks, there are 4 blocks need to repair are marked in gray color (block 2, 3, 6 and 8).\n\nIf they have only 2 unit of money to repair this road, to get maximum the number of consecutive blocks that vehicles can move on after repair, they must to repair the block 6 and 8, then the vehicles can move from block 4 to block 11, and the length is 8.\n\u00a0\nGiven a status of road, print out the maximum consecutive blocks that vehicles can move on after repair with maximum K unit of money. The answer for the above example should be 8.\nInput\nThe total number of test cases T (1 \u00a0T ) will be given the in the first line.\nEach test case will be given in the following 2 lines, the first line of each test case is a number of blocks of the road N (5 <= N <= 10000)\u00a0and a number K (0 <= K <= N)\u00a0separated by a space. The next line is the status of road, those blocks were damaged are indicated with '0' and those not are indicated with '1'. Adjacent blocks in the same line are separated with a blank space.\nOutput\nPrint the answer for each test case on 1 line.\n \n\u00a0\nSample\n\n\n\n\nInput\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n2\n10 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n11 2\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1   1\n\n\n7\n8\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n<\nPrevious\n1\n2\nNext\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntuanyato: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-12-28 07:45:22\n\nget all block to a array, I passed with comlexity is On\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njainsahil1997: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-08-25 22:42:32\n\nMy 40th.

It is so weak that at most one car can stay over the bridge at any moment. Few cars are waiting on both ends of the bridge forming a queue and they want to cross the bridge. Cars on the same side of the bridge are in the same lane and cars on different sides of the bridge are in different lanes. No car can overtake any other car or change its lane; otherwise, they will be fined. So only the cars which are at the front of their queue have the chance to cross the bridge. Given the time needed for each car to cross the bridge, find the optimal order of cars passing the bridge such that the maximum waiting time of a car is minimized [See sample input/output and the explanation section for better understanding]. Waiting time for a car is equal to the time it has to wait before stepping onto the bridge. You can assume that the time needed for a car to get to the bridge or to get down from the bridge is negligible.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains two integers,\u00a0T, denoting the number of test cases. Then for each test case you will first be given two integers,\u00a0N\u00a0&\u00a0M.

It follows a single line having\u00a0N\u00a0integers.\u00a0i-th integer of this line denotes the time needed for the\u00a0i-th car to pass the road in seconds\u00a0[ the car at the front of the queue is considered to be the 1st car ].

    "Description": "\nYou are on a highway of two lanes. There is a bridge on the highway which is almost broken. It is so weak that at most one car can stay over the bridge at any moment. Few cars are waiting on both ends of the bridge forming a queue and they want to cross the bridge. Cars on the same side of the bridge are in the same lane and cars on different sides of the bridge are in different lanes. No car can overtake any other car or change its lane; otherwise, they will be fined. So only the cars which are at the front of their queue have the chance to cross the bridge. Given the time needed for each car to cross the bridge, find the optimal order of cars passing the bridge such that the maximum waiting time of a car is minimized [See sample input/output and the explanation section for better understanding]. Waiting time for a car is equal to the time it has to wait before stepping onto the bridge. You can assume that the time needed for a car to get to the bridge or to get down from the bridge is negligible."

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRIGAMI - Bytelandian Origami\n\n\nno tags\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nMany of Johnny's school friends have perfected the art of folding a square sheet of paper into beautiful shapes (known as origami). Johnny attempted to follow suit, but to his dismay he found that his fingers were a little to clumsy for the task in hand. After spending yet another day creating something especially disastrous (later named \"From the series: Crumpled Pieces of Paper Seen with an Artist's Eye, No. 27\"), Johnny decided he'd had enough. Therefore he proudly proclaimed to all his friends that origami was not fit for serious people, and that he intended to become the master of kirigami, the art of cutting paper. But after experimenting with kirigami for a few weeks, he sold the rather miserable results of his labour to the local confetti store, and announced that true beauty lay in convex polygons, and that they were the only shapes a true artist should ever cut. Still, if a person is as lazy and inapt as Johnny, even such a seemingly simple task may turn out a real challenge.\n\nThe method Johnny uses to create works of art consists of several steps. First, he takes a sheet of paper in the shape of a convex polygon and uses a ruler and pencil to draw a convex polygon  (lying entirely within the sheet). Then, he proceeds to cut it out using a ruler and a razor-edged paper cutter.

    "Description": "\n\nMany of Johnny's school friends have perfected the art of folding a square sheet of paper into beautiful shapes (known as origami). Johnny attempted to follow suit, but to his dismay he found that his fingers were a little to clumsy for the task in hand. After spending yet another day creating something especially disastrous (later named \"From the series: Crumpled Pieces of Paper Seen with an Artist's Eye, No. 27\"), Johnny decided he'd had enough. Therefore he proudly proclaimed to all his friends that origami was not fit for serious people, and that he intended to become the master of kirigami, the art of cutting paper. But after experimenting with kirigami for a few weeks, he sold the rather miserable results of his labour to the local confetti store, and announced that true beauty lay in convex polygons, and that they were the only shapes a true artist should ever cut. Still, if a person is as lazy and inapt as Johnny, even such a seemingly simple task may turn out a real challenge.\n\nThe method Johnny uses to create works of art consists of several steps. First, he takes a sheet of paper in the shape of a convex polygon and uses a ruler and pencil to draw a convex polygon  (lying entirely within the sheet). Then, he proceeds to cut it out using a ruler and a razor-edged paper cutter. Every cut is thus a segment of a line, reaching from one edge of the sheet of paper to another, and adjacent to one side of the drawn polygon. Johnny then discards the cut off corner of the sheet and continues cutting until the shape outlined in pencil is completely cut out. Since he is extremely disinclined to perform hard work, please write a program to help him minimise the total length of the lines along which the paper is cut.\n"

As is it is a hot summer day, most of the fire brigade have quite naturally taken a day off, and so the noble task of extinguishing all the fires falls to the only officer on duty. By now you will probably not be surprised to learn that he is in fact... Johnny. This enterprising youth remains undaunted by the challenge facing him, and, taking advantage of the absence of his superiors, he decides to use his favourite fire fighting technique. So, he loads the fire station's helicopter with as many dynamite charges as it can carry, and takes off on his errand of mercy.\n\nFrom up there in the sky Johnny can see the city as a square, sliced into smaller, identical squares by a regular grid of streets.

In a desperate effort to divert the public's attention and ingratiate himself with his subjects, he decides to start giving out valuable gifts. This time he has chosen to harass the peaceful life of the CEO of Bytelandian Telecom, and requested him to create a Metropolitan Area Network for the citizens of the capital of Byteland, as part of an \"our King is a good man\" campaign.\nThe CEO has no choice but to obey the orders he receives. This rational and business-minded man would obviously like to perform the installation at the smallest possible cost, and he asks you for your help.\n\nThe King has stated the topology of the network plainly enough in the form of a graph (not necessarily connected), with vertices corresponding to nodes (computers), and edges to the cable connections between them. It is now your task to select the points of the city to place the nodes of the network at. The city is a regular mesh of streets (depicted as vertical and horizontal segments on a map), with crossroads located at points with integer coordinates. Nodes may only be located at crossroads of streets (no two nodes at the same crossroad). Cables may only run along streets and must connect nodes by the shortest possible route under this constraint. Moreover, a cable of precisely such length must be currently in stock (you are provided with a list of possible cable lengths).\n\nTry to layout the network in such a way as to minimise the total length of cable used.\n\nInput\n\nThe input starts with a line containing integer t <= 1000, the number of test cases. t test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test cases begins with integer k, denoting the number of different available cable lengths, followed by k space separated integers pj corresponding to the allowed lengths of cables (1 <= k <= 100, 1 <= pj <= 100).

    "Description": "\n\nKing Johnny has a serious drink problem, which has recently become the focus of attention of all Bytelandian tabloids and colour magazines. In a desperate effort to divert the public's attention and ingratiate himself with his subjects, he decides to start giving out valuable gifts. This time he has chosen to harass the peaceful life of the CEO of Bytelandian Telecom, and requested him to create a Metropolitan Area Network for the citizens of the capital of Byteland, as part of an \"our King is a good man\" campaign.\nThe CEO has no choice but to obey the orders he receives. This rational and business-minded man would obviously like to perform the installation at the smallest possible cost, and he asks you for your help.\n\nThe King has stated the topology of the network plainly enough in the form of a graph (not necessarily connected), with vertices corresponding to nodes (computers), and edges to the cable connections between them. It is now your task to select the points of the city to place the nodes of the network at. The city is a regular mesh of streets (depicted as vertical and horizontal segments on a map), with crossroads located at points with integer coordinates. Nodes may only be located at crossroads of streets (no two nodes at the same crossroad). Cables may only run along streets and must connect nodes by the shortest possible route under this constraint. Moreover, a cable of precisely such length must be currently in stock (you are provided with a list of possible cable lengths).\n\nTry to layout the network in such a way as to minimise the total length of cable used.\n"

One of them is the Game of Crosses & Crosses, with the following set of rules:\n\nTwo players - red and black - take it in turns to place one cross of their respective color on an unoccupied square of the n x n gaming board. Red starts the game.\nAfter each player's move any rectangles with sides equal to at least 2, lying entirely within the gaming board and covered completely by crosses, are simultaneously removed (cut off) from the gaming board and the game continues.\nWhen all the squares remaining in the gaming board are covered by crosses, the game comes to an end. The score of each player is equal to the number of crosses of his color left standing on the gaming board, and the player with the higher score is considered the winner.\n\n\nThe game of crosses & crosses feels rather like playing a degenerated game of Go with an army of suicide bombers. For many years now it has been the favourite passtime of Bytelandian schoolchildren during their lessons.

So when a few years after Johnny's abdication from the throne of Byteland an unsuspecting publisher signed a million dolar contract with the ex-king for a series of memoirs entitled The famous victories of Johnny the Great, he was certainly not prepared for what he received -- a detailed account of Johnny's childhood games of crosses & crosses. To make matters worse, all accounts are written by Johnny in exciting prose, rich in action, e.g.: \"Then I played yet another game on a 3x3 board. I placed my first cross at (1,1).

One of things that the citizens liked most about Johnny was that whenever he had a hangover, he would sign any public petition brought forth to him, just for the sake of peace and quiet. Rail travel was extremely popular, and lots of cities and villages requested railway lines connecting them directly, to which King Johnny always graciously agreed (even if he wasn't quite sure what he was agreeing to). Seeing that money was no object, the railway tracks were built in such a way as to connect pairs of cities directly, along straight lines. If two railroads intersected, a complex intersection involving bridges and tunnels was built and everyone seemed perfectly happy.\n\nAnd then after Johnny's abdication, democracy returned, and the happy days of Byteland ended. One of the first things that had to be done was closing down most of the railway lines. The new government intends to disassemble a large part of the direct railway connections, preserving barely enough to make travel possible between any two cities (perhaps via other cities on the way). The total cost of maintenance of the lines which remain open, equal to k Bytelandian Dollars per kilometer of track open and l Bytelandian Dollars per intersection of 2 used tracks, is to be as low as possible. Please help the government decide which railroads should remain open.\n\nInput\nInput starts with a single integer t, the number of test cases (t<=100). t test cases follow.\n\nEach test case begins with a line containing two integers n m k l, denoting the number of cities, the number of direct connections between cities, the cost of upkeep of a kilometer of track, and the cost of upkeep of a single railway line intersection, respectively (3<=n<=m<=10000, 0<=k,l<=100000). Each of the next n lines contains two integers xi yi, corresponding to the X and Y coordinates of the i-th city, measured in kilometers, respectively (-40000<=xi,yi<=40000).

A good solution to this problem is very important e.g. when developing digital cameras. In this task we are given a set of pictures, each of which is a grayscale image, transferred by some communication channel with failures. During the transfer some data was corrupted. A picture is defined as a rectangular matrix of integers from the range from 0 (black) to 255 (white). A number X at position (i, j) means that the pixel in the picture at the point with coordinates x = i and y = j has color RGB(X, X, X). The considered form of corruption generates noise in the following way: each pixel of the picture has its color replaced with probability between 2 and 20% by a random value from the range [0; 255].  Thus, you now receive a set of corrupted pictures, which were originally e.g. avatars, banners or photos. You are to restore the picture with maximum quality. The more exact a picture you obtain, the fewer penalty points you get.\n\n\n\nOriginal Picture\nGrayscale Picture\nNoised Picture\nDenoised Picture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nInput\nt \u2013 the number of test cases [t <= 60] (total number about 250), then t test cases follows. Each test case begins with three integers: Q, H and W, denoting the noise probability for the generator in percent, and the height and width of picture respectively [2 <= Q <= 20], [10 <= H, W <= 200].  Then H rows follow with W integers in each of them.\nOutput\nFor each test case you must output a picture after noise reduction in following format: In the first line output the two integers H and W. Then H rows must follow with W integers in each of them. Each integer is the color value of a pixel after the restoration process.\nScore\nThe score of the program will be equal to the sum of scores for each single test case + 1.  The number of points for a single test case is calculated from the formula: score = sqrt((x[1][1]1 - x[1][1]2)^2 + (x[1][2]1 - x[1][2]2)^2 + .... + (x[H][W]1-x[H][W]2)^2), where x[i][j]1 is the color of the pixel at position i, j in the restored picture and x[i][j]2 is the color of the pixel at position i, j in the original picture.\nExample\nInput:\n1\n6 20 20\n 255 255 255 255 255 255 255 255

    "Description": "\nOne of the most interesting problems of contemporary times is digital image processing to remove noise. A good solution to this problem is very important e.g. when developing digital cameras. In this task we are given a set of pictures, each of which is a grayscale image, transferred by some communication channel with failures. During the transfer some data was corrupted. A picture is defined as a rectangular matrix of integers from the range from 0 (black) to 255 (white). A number X at position (i, j) means that the pixel in the picture at the point with coordinates x = i and y = j has color RGB(X, X, X). The considered form of corruption generates noise in the following way: each pixel of the picture has its color replaced with probability between 2 and 20% by a random value from the range [0; 255].  Thus, you now receive a set of corrupted pictures, which were originally e.g. avatars, banners or photos. You are to restore the picture with maximum quality. The more exact a picture you obtain, the fewer penalty points you get.\n\n\n\nOriginal Picture\nGrayscale Picture\nNoised Picture\nDenoised Picture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0"

As a punishment he was told off and assigned additional homework. The teacher underlined quite a few words in a dictionary and asked Johnny to rewrite all of them to his notebook.\n\nJohnny wasn't at all pleased about this, since writing by hand is always a painful burden. Fortunately, Johnny's dad took pity on the crying boy and offered to help. He presented his son with a few sheets of carbon paper, thanks to which any text Johnny wrote was at once ready in exactly k copies. Some of the characters of particular copies could then be erased using a white correction pen, so as to obtain only the words required by the teacher. All the characters forming a single word have to be directly adjacent, but words can be written in any order on the sheets and different words can be separated by an arbitrary (possibly 0) amount of space.\n\nJohnny has cheered up considerably by now, since the bit with the carbon paper and correction pen sounds rather fun. All that remains to be done is to write down an appropriate text, obviously keeping it as short as possible. Please advise Johnny what to write.\n\nInput\n\nInput begins with a single integer t (t=1000). t test cases follow.\n\nEach test case starts with a line containing two integers n k, respectively denoting the number of words the teacher has asked Johnny to write and the total number of carbon copies that Johnny creates, including the original (1<=k<=n<=512). Each of the next n lines contains a word assigned by the teacher - a string of between 4 and 12 characters 'a', 'b', 'c' or 'd'. All words given at input are Bytelandian nouns in common use.\n\nOutput\nFor the i-th test case output a line with the text case i Y or case i N, specifying whether you wish to solve the given case.

    "Description": "\nOne day when Johnny was still a schoolboy he got caught red-handed by his teacher while doing a Very Mischievous Thing (of the sort that you would expect of Johnny). As a punishment he was told off and assigned additional homework. The teacher underlined quite a few words in a dictionary and asked Johnny to rewrite all of them to his notebook.\n\nJohnny wasn't at all pleased about this, since writing by hand is always a painful burden. Fortunately, Johnny's dad took pity on the crying boy and offered to help. He presented his son with a few sheets of carbon paper, thanks to which any text Johnny wrote was at once ready in exactly k copies. Some of the characters of particular copies could then be erased using a white correction pen, so as to obtain only the words required by the teacher. All the characters forming a single word have to be directly adjacent, but words can be written in any order on the sheets and different words can be separated by an arbitrary (possibly 0) amount of space.\n\nJohnny has cheered up considerably by now, since the bit with the carbon paper and correction pen sounds rather fun. All that remains to be done is to write down an appropriate text, obviously keeping it as short as possible. Please advise Johnny what to write.\n"

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJAWB - JawBreaker Game\n\n\nno tags\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nThe goal of this popular game is to get maximum number of points, by removing aligned pieces of the same color. Pieces can only be removed if they touch each other by an entire side. The more pieces you remove in one turn, the more points you get. The number of points in one turn is described by the following formula: N*(N-1), where N is the number of pieces (for example 2*(2-1)=2, 10*(10-1)=90). If you remove pieces from the middle of the field, then all pieces located higher fall down and occupy the empty spaces. The game is finished when no pieces which can be removed from field remain. \n\n\u00a0\nIn this problem you will be given a field and pieces on it. Your goal is to obtain the maximum number of points.\nNote: You can practice a little and plan your strategy with this on-line game [the on-line game is slightly different from the one described above]: http://www.bigfrog.net/jawbreaker/\nInput\nt \u2013 the number of tests, then t tests follow. [t <= 500] Each test starts with 3 integers: H - the number of rows of the playing field, W - the number of columns of the playing field and C - the number of different colors of pieces. [4 <= H, W <= 50] and  [3 <= C <= 20]. Then follow H rows with W numbers in each, separated by spaces. Each number is in the range from 0 to C-1 and describes the color of a piece.\nOutput\nFor each test you must output the letter \u201cY\u201d if you want to solve this test, or the letter \u201cN\u201d otherwise. If you output Y, you must output a set of lines with 2 integers x, y in each. These integers define rows and columns in the field. [0 <= x < H], [0 <= y < W].

    "Description": "\nThe goal of this popular game is to get maximum number of points, by removing aligned pieces of the same color. Pieces can only be removed if they touch each other by an entire side. The more pieces you remove in one turn, the more points you get. The number of points in one turn is described by the following formula: N*(N-1), where N is the number of pieces (for example 2*(2-1)=2, 10*(10-1)=90). If you remove pieces from the middle of the field, then all pieces located higher fall down and occupy the empty spaces. The game is finished when no pieces which can be removed from field remain. \n\n\u00a0\nIn this problem you will be given a field and pieces on it. Your goal is to obtain the maximum number of points.\nNote: You can practice a little and plan your strategy with this on-line game [the on-line game is slightly different from the one described above]: http://www.bigfrog.net/jawbreaker/"

(Someone actually asked about the compiler options here and received a reply, but I don't think there are any options that would have made a difference for that.) It's not possible to \"revert\" to something that was never used. Also, the first part of my previous comment isn't relevant anymore, since it was about possible unfairness competing against Alex Gevak's score.\n\nYou can test your BF programs on ideone, which uses the same interpreter as SPOJ, or by downloading it from the author's website ( http://swapped.cc/#!/bff ).\nLast edit: 2014-05-27 22:01:19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto_test: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2014-05-27 10:09:44\n\ncould you not revert to the previous compiler, [-] gives me TLE every time.\n\nAn interpreter such as at http://esoteric.sange.fi/brainfuck/impl/interp/i.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitch Schwartz: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2012-08-05 08:53:40\n\nBased on the problem description and some forum posts, Thomas Cort's BF2C was used on SPOJ when the problem was published, but now clearly Alex Pankratov's bff 1.0.3.1 is used, and I've had trouble determining whether this is an issue. The problem is that BF2C relies on GCC version and compiler options, so for example it's tough to say how a program like \"-[-]\" would have run when the problem was published. As far as I can tell, my current best solution would NOT have gotten AC at that time, and it may be possible that some old AC solutions wouldn't get AC now, so this is potentially an issue.\n\nIf the problem setter is still available, a comment addressing this would be appreciated.\n\nClarification on how the judge handles whitespace in output would also be nice; from what I remember, it's something like: program's output is compared with judge output on a line by line basis, and program output for any particular line must match judge output character-for-character except that trailing whitespace is allowed, and arbitrary extra whitespace is also allowed at the end of the program output. But making experiments is annoying, and I can't see why the standard \"ignores extra whitespaces\" judge wasn't used in the first place.\nLast edit: 2012-08-05 12:08:33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJared Deckard: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2012-01-31 01:55:21\n\n!(06>=10)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitch Schwartz: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2012-01-30 08:17:46\n\nBe careful: the judge for this problem is somehow strict regarding whitespace in output.

As you may well imagine, this does lead to peculiar problems sometimes.\nOn one occassion the King of Bitland came on a state visit to Byteland, and, to everybody's surprise, decided he would take a stroll in the Mammoth Park. Since mammoths tend to be a little unpredictable and know nothing of the protocol of royal visits, they had to be tied up for the time being.

Usually, at the start of the game the players are distributed fairly randomly over the board, and run around in order to find and shoot opponents.\nBut there is a fair percentage of players (especially the younger ones) who enjoy the shooting most and give up the running altogether. To achieve this, at the start of the match all players are arranged very close to each other, and everyone opens fire in the very first second of the game.

The goal is simple -- to discover (or more precisely: uncover) the positions of all mines in rectangular grid. After a field without a mine on it is uncovered, the revealed value shows how many neighboring cells (at most 8) are occupied by mines. In the puzzle, just as in the game, you know the total number of mines on the board. But unlike in the game, you are not asked to risk your life by uncovering fields.

This means that, ever so often, once his sack is partially or completely empty, Santa has to fly back to his base in Lapland to replenish his supplies. So irksome has this become that Santa has decided to resort to modern operational research to aid him in his sack-packing and route planning. Please write a program which will guide Santa through his daily chores.\n\nInput\nThe input starts with a line containing a single integer t<=100, the number of test cases. t test cases follow. \n\nThe first line of every test case consists of four integers n x y S, denoting the number of good children who will receive a present from Santa, the x and y coordinates of Santa's home base, and the amount of space in the sack, respectively (1<=n<=10000, -10000<=x,y<=10000, 1<=S<=100000). n lines follow, each consisting of three integers xi yi si - the x and y coordinates of the i-th child's home, and the amount of space taken up by this child's present when in Santa's sack, respectively (-10000<=xi,yi<=10000, 1<=si<=S).\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output a sequence of space separated integers, corresponding to successive actions that should be taken by Santa:\n\n\n-i (1<=i<=n) signifies that Santa should travel to his base and pack the present for the i-th child into his sack (he needs to have sufficient room in his sack to do this).\n\ni (1<=i<=n) signifies that Santa should travel to the i-th child's home and leave a present for him/her.\n\n\n0 signifies that Santa should travel back to his base and end his Christmas activity (and that you want to proceed to the next test case).\n\n\n\n\nAssume that Santa starts in his base and always travels between points by the shortest possible route (along straight lines).

But have you ever wondered what you could do if you got a real Turing Machine -- one of those big metal things with all the cranks and levers and rolls of infinite tape that looks suspiciously like toilet paper?...\n\nThe sad answer is: there are few interesting things that can be done with such a machine. Even problems that have a little charm in the theoretical model (like the intractable Halting Problem) can be solved very efficiently with practical brute-force algorithms (see e.g. the figure at the end of the problem description). But there is one thing that you can do with a practical Turing Machine, and can't do with a theoretical one, and it is: to use it as a music box.Our Turing Machine has exactly one state variable (an integer in the range 0 to 999) and is equipped with an infinite tape, consisting of cells with symbols from a given alphabet encoded on them. A movable read/write head is positioned over some cell of the tape, and is operated according to the list of rules encoded in the machine. The rules are of the form S1 C1 S2 C2 M, which means: if the machine is in state S1 and C1 is written in the current cell, change state to S2, write C2 in the current cell, and move the head as described by move M (one cell left, one cell right, or not at all). If no matching rule is found for the given state the machine should halt.\nNow, here is the good bit. The head makes a creaking sound when performing each rule. It goes da when moved right, di when moved left, and um when left in place. Suppose that each cell of the tape can contain one of 16 possible symbols, formed as the concatenation of exactly two of the words: da, di, um and sh for silence. Initially, nearly all the cells of the tape are filled with the symbol shsh. Only a few (not more than 500) consecutive cells form a piece of music, each cell encoding a pair of sounds (one of 9 combinations of da, di or um, without any silences). The head of the machine is initially positioned over the leftmost of the cells containing sounds.\nNow it is your task to use the Turing machine to play the piece of music written on its tape (as read from left to right, starting from the initial position of the head, as far as the first silence) as accurately as possible, using the head itself to produce the sounds required.\nOutput\nThe output of your program must contain a set of rules describing the behaviour of the Turing Machine designed for playing music. Each rule must be of the form S1 C1 S2 C2 M, where S1 and S2 are integers from the range 0..999, C1 and C2 belong to the 16 symbols of the alphabet, while M describes the move direction of the head by the sound it makes (da, di or um).\n\nScore\n\nYour program will be tested multiple times for different pieces of music written on the tape. The score of your program is equal to the total of non-negative scores, taken over all test cases.\n\nFor a test case with n notes (n/2 non-silent cells) your program will receive n-d points, where d denotes the edit distance between the music played and the music required (i.e. the minimum total number of notes that have to be inserted into or changed in both the pieces to obtain the same piece of music).\n\nExample\n\nConsider the following set of rules output by a program:\n000 dada 000 dada da\n000 umda 000 dada da\n000 shsh 000 shsh da\n000 didi 001 didi di\n001 dada 002 didi di\n\n\nThen the results of exemplary testing could be as follows:\nMusic: da da|da da|da da|di di|um um\nPlays: da da da di di\nScore: 5\n\nMusic: um da|um da|um da|da um|di di\nPlays: da da da\nScore: 3\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 = 8 points\n\nBonus info: There are no more than 100 tests.

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTR - Tetris AI\n\n\n#bubble-cup-6-round-1\n\n\n\n\n In the very heart of a well known producer of microelectronic products, a mobile phone with a built in game of Network Tetris is being prepared for release. The owners of such mobile phones can arrange duels when at a small distance from each other. Data transmission between players is carried out using the Bluetooth protocol. \n\nHowever -- now we are coming to the point -- it sometimes happens that there may be no other similar phone nearby and the player may need to play alone. For this purpose it is necessary to write a computer player (AI) with a very hard difficulty level. \n\nThe rules of Network Tetris are pretty simple :\n\nThe game has two playing fields, each with the rules of standard Tetris: figures of 4 blocks keep falling from the top of the field, and have to placed in such a way as to form horizontal lines. Once a line is filled up, it is removed and all lines above it are appropriately shifted downwards. There is however one difference with respect to standard Tetris -- a player receives additional penalty lines as soon as his opponent clears a line. The game is over when one of players fills his own field, either on his own or with his opponent's help, to such an extent, that the next figure cannot fully enter the field.\n\nThe width of the field is 10, and the height of field is 20. There are 6 types of figures in the game:\nI (1) - \nL (2) - \nJ (3) - \nZ (4) - \nS (5) - \nO (6) - \n\nIt is your task to write a bot which starts with an empty field and, knowing the sequence of figures dropping on its field, plays in such a way as to do as much harm as possible to the opponent.\nInput\nt \u2013 number of test cases [t <= 150], then t tests follow.\nEach test case starts with integer N equal to the number of figures which drop onto the field [10 <= N <= 50000]. Then N integers follow, numbered from 1 to 6 \u2013 denoting one of the figures, in the same position as they appear in the pictures. (Look at numbers in parenthesis).\n\nOutput\nFor each test you should output line case 1 Y if you wish to solve this test case or case 1 N otherwise. If you output Y, then exactly N lines must follow. Each of them should contain exactly two integers: A and X, where A is the clockwise angle of rotation in the given move, numbered from 0 to 3 (0 - 0 degrees, 1 - 90 degrees, 2 - 180 degrees, 3 - 270 degrees), while X is the horizontal coordinate of leftmost cube of the figure [1 <= x <= 10]. The i-th figure at input corresponds to the i-th figure at output. If the figure falls outside the field or the parameters have incorrect value, or any falling figure stops with at least one cube in a line of number larger than 20, then the solution will be judged as Wrong Answer.\n\nScore\nThe score will be equal to the total number of cleared lines, taken over all test cases.

Each of them should contain exactly two integers: A and X, where A is the clockwise angle of rotation in the given move, numbered from 0 to 3 (0 - 0 degrees, 1 - 90 degrees, 2 - 180 degrees, 3 - 270 degrees), while X is the horizontal coordinate of leftmost cube of the figure [1 <= x <= 10].

    "Description": "\n In the very heart of a well known producer of microelectronic products, a mobile phone with a built in game of Network Tetris is being prepared for release. The owners of such mobile phones can arrange duels when at a small distance from each other. Data transmission between players is carried out using the Bluetooth protocol. \n\nHowever -- now we are coming to the point -- it sometimes happens that there may be no other similar phone nearby and the player may need to play alone. For this purpose it is necessary to write a computer player (AI) with a very hard difficulty level. \n\nThe rules of Network Tetris are pretty simple :\n\nThe game has two playing fields, each with the rules of standard Tetris: figures of 4 blocks keep falling from the top of the field, and have to placed in such a way as to form horizontal lines. Once a line is filled up, it is removed and all lines above it are appropriately shifted downwards. There is however one difference with respect to standard Tetris -- a player receives additional penalty lines as soon as his opponent clears a line. The game is over when one of players fills his own field, either on his own or with his opponent's help, to such an extent, that the next figure cannot fully enter the field.\n\nThe width of the field is 10, and the height of field is 20. There are 6 types of figures in the game:\nI (1) - \nL (2) - \nJ (3) - \nZ (4) - \nS (5) - \nO (6) - \n\nIt is your task to write a bot which starts with an empty field and, knowing the sequence of figures dropping on its field, plays in such a way as to do as much harm as possible to the opponent."

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRICKGM - Colour Brick Game\n\n\n#bubble-cup-7-round-2\n\n\n\n\nBRICKGM\nLet's consider the tetris like game. The rules are very easy, there is board of width 10 and height 20. Colour bricks fall down the board. Every brick contains 3 colours. Player can rotate colours in the brick and determine the column, in which to place current brick. The goal is to construct horizontal, vertical or diagonal lines of length 3 or more in the same colour. After every brick falls down, the cleaning up algorithm is executed.\nSingle step of cleaning up algorithm searchs for lines constructed from cells with the same colour (there can be more than one such line). If no line is found, the algorithm finishes. Otherwise all cells in all found lines disappear, then the cells above this dissapeared cells fall down. The cleaning up algorithm executes single steps as long, as there are any changes on the board.\nThe brick can be rotated. When the brick contains colours A, B, C (from top to bottom), then single rotation makes the brick with colours C, A, B, and double rotation makes the brick with colours B, C, A.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nTask\nYour task is to write the program, which can play in Colour Brick Game. You will receive the consecutive bricks and for each of them have to determine the correct column and rotation. For each cleaned line You got points (according to scoring section). The goal is to maximize the score.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains single-space separated integers n and k (3 \u2264 k \u2264 9, 1 \u2264\u00a0n*k \u2264\u00a0106), where n is the number of bricks in the game and k is the number of different colours, that can appear in the game. The next n lines contain bricks description, one line per brick. Each brick is represented as string of length 3, containing digits (every digit is from 1 to k).\nOutput\nFor every brick from the input, You should write a line with two single-space separated integers x and r (1 \u2264 x \u2264 10, 0 \u2264 r \u2264 2), where x is the number of column to place the brick and r is the rotation of the brick (0 for no rotation, 1 for single rotation, 2 for double rotation).\nIf after falling down the brick is located outside the board (the higher brick cell is higher than the highest board row), the game finishes immediately. The judge doesn't read the remaining moves, so You don't need to output them. You can also stop, when there is no valid move at the board and You don't need to output this last move.\nScoring\nBase score for cleaned line of length m is m2. The base score is multiplied by the number of lines cleaned in single cleaning up step and then multiplied by the cleaning up step number (see example for clarify).\nThe brick score is sum of scores received from cleaned lines after the brick falled down.\nTotal score is sum of brick scores.\nExample\n\n\n\nInput 1:\nOutput 1:\n\n\n11 5 211 321 232 233 345 245 451 332 451 332 312\n 1 1 2 0 3 0 3 2 4 0 5 0 6 0 6 0 7 0 7 0 8 1\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nInput 2:\nOutput 2:\n\n\n11 5 211 321 232 233 345 245 451 332 451 332 312\n 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0    \n\n\n\nExplanation\nIn first example, for the first 10 bricks there is no line to clean.

The King's Court is eagerly anticipating the arrival of notable guests and crowned heads from all round the continent, who will partake of the ceremonial strawberry donut dinner in the Royal Halls. But this year, just before the feast is due to commence, disaster has struck: The Recipe for strawberry donuts, jealously guarded by the Lord Master of the Household, has been destroyed in a kitchen fire caused by an overturned frying pan!\nPanic and dispair have spread through the King's Court. Without The Recipe, noone is able to fry a half-reasonable donut. The one hope of salvation is in an old, almost forgotten legend, which says that in a far-off part of Byteland, there lives a dynasty of Wicked Old Witches, who hold another copy of The Recipe, treasuring it and passing it on from mother to daughter. In a valiant effort to save the face of the Kingdom of Byteland, you set out on an expedition to find the Witches and their strawberry donut Recipe!\nAfter climbing many hills and crossing many seas, you eventually reach a small village in which all of the legendary Witches dwell. The good news is that one copy of the Recipe is still in existance, and is held by one of the living witches. To make things even better, it turns out that the Witches are not as Wicked as the legend states: in fact, they are quite sociable, and may even help you locate the witch who has the Recipe. However, each witch will insist on telling you her life story first, before you can get any useful information out of her. And they are all Old Witches, so it may take a while, and you really don't want to interrupt a Witch when she is talking. Only after a Witch has recounted her countless tales, will she tell you what she knows about the recipe, which will be something along the following lines:\n\n\"The recipe? Oh dear, I'm sorry, I've never seen it myself...\"\u00a0\n\"The recipe? Yes, I do remember... I had it once, many years ago, but I have since passed it on to my most talented daughter (and here comes the name of the daughter in question). Her cooking is so much better than mine, you know!\"\n\"The recipe? But why of course! Here it is. Just make sure you keep it safe!\" (This is the answer you want to hear, but you will only hear it from the one Witch who has the recipe.)\n\nMardi Gras is drawing near, and you may sadly not have enough time to talk to all the charming Old Witches. Try to figure out a way to obtain the recipe, and to do it as quickly as possible!\u00a0\nInput\nThe input starts with a single positive integer integer k, denoting the number of Witches in the dynasty (k < 106). The next line starts with the name of the oldest Witch, from whom all the other Witches are descended, and who of course must have once held the recipe, even if she may perhaps not have it now. The input line describing this Witch is of the form:\nName chats x\u00a0min.\nEach of the next k-1 lines contains a description of a Witch, formatted as follows:\nName is the daughter of Mother's-Name and chats x\u00a0min.\nThe number x\u00a0describes the number of minutes of your time a Witch will take up if you talk to her: an integer between 1 and 106. All names of witches are sequences of exactly 5 letters, starting with one upper-case letter (A-Z) and followed by 4 lower-case letters (a-z). The order of Witches at input is such that each Witch is described later than her mother. No two Witches in the dynasty share the same name.\nOutput\nYour output should describe the strategy you adopt when talking to the witches, with a complete plan of action, stating who to approach in what order, depending on previously obtained answers.\nFirst, print the name of the witch you approach as the first, followed by a list of clauses of the form ANSWER\u00a0->\u00a0FURTHER_ACTION, one clause corresponding to each of the possible answers which may be given by the Witch. For every Witch, you should consider all possible answers the witch may give you, which are feasible given the information you have obtained so far from other Witches. For compactness, assume that in the case when a Witch directs you to her daughter, the ANSWER string\u00a0is simply to be the name of the daughter in question. If the Witch answers that she has no idea of the recipe, the ANSWER string\u00a0should be: NEVER. If a Witch tells you she has the recipe, no further action needs to be taken, and you shoud not write any text corresponding to such an answer in your output file.\u00a0(In particular, if you can be sure that the Witch you have just asked has the recipe, you should not print text corresponding to any answers given by this Witch.) The\u00a0ANSWER\u00a0string\u00a0should be followed by a description of FURTHER_ACTION to take, representing actions which you will subsequently take, subject to the given answer. The FURTHER_ACTION  should be written down following the same grammar rules as those describing the whole of your program's output (i.e., this paragraph is to be read recursively).\u00a0\nWhite spaces (spaces, newlines, and tabs), numbers, and punctuation marks may be inserted arbitrarily into your program's output to improve its formatting; they will be disregarded when testing your solution. The order in which you consider the possible answers of each Witch is arbitrary.\u00a0\nIn your strategy\u00a0 you may never approach a Witch if, based on information received so far, you can be sure she does not have the recipe. You can assume that Witches always tell the truth, and should not print any text corresponding to the case of an answer which you already know may not occur. You can also safely assume that the recipe does not change hands while you are in the Witches' village.\nScoring\nFor each data set, the score of your program will be computed as the ratio of two integer values, t / T. Here, t\u00a0denotes the number of minutes required for a conversation with the most talkative Witch in the dynasty, and T\u00a0is the total amount of time your strategy takes to find the recipe for a worst-case scenario of answers.\nYour program will be tested for multiple data files. The overall score of your program will be the average of scores obtained for individual data sets.\nNotes\nThe time limit of your program for each data set is 10 seconds. Your program must not print more than 30MB of output text (whitespace included!). The number of Witches k will be approximately\u00a0103 (for half of the tests) and approximately 105\u00a0(for the remaining tests).\nExample\nInput:\n5\nAlice chats 20 min.\nBetty is the daughter of Alice and chats 10 min.\nChloe is the daughter of Alice and chats 10 min.\nMarie is the daughter of Chloe and chats 30 min.\nSuzie is the daughter of Marie and chats 10 min.\n\nSample output 1:\n1. Chloe:\n   * \"Marie!\"\n      2. Suzie:\n         * \"NEVER!\"\n            3. Marie.\n   * \"NEVER!\"\n      2. Alice:\n         * \"Betty!\"\n            3. Betty.\n\nScore: 0.6\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the presented solution, you first approach Chloe and talk to her for 10 minutes.\nIf Chloe tells you she gave the recipe to her only daughter, Marie, then you next approach Suzie and talk to her for 10 minutes. If she does not have the recipe, then it must be with Marie; you talk to her next for 30 minutes, and obtain the recipe (after at most 50 minutes in total).\nIf Chloe tells you she has not seen the recipe, you next approach Alice. As the oldest witch, Alice must have seen the recipe, and if she doesn't have it, she must have given it to Betty. Talking to Alice takes up 20 minutes of your time, and talking to Betty takes up another 10 minutes. In this case, you will obtain the recipe after at most 40 minutes.\nThe score of your program is the time required to talk to the most talkative witch in the dynasty, Marie, divided by the worst-case time needed to obtain the recipe in the provided solution, i.e., 30/50.\nSample output 2:\n1. Alice:\n   * \"Chloe!\"\n      2. Chloe:\n         * \"Marie!\"\n           3. Marie:\n              * \"Suzie!\"\n                 4. Suzie.\n   * \"Betty!\"\n      2. Betty.\n\nScore: 0.429\n\nSample output 3:\n1. Alice:\n   * \"Chloe!\"\n      2. Betty:\netc.\n\nEvaluation: Wrong Answer.\n\n\nNote that once you know the Recipe is in Chloe's part of the family, it cannot be with Betty.\nSample output 4:\n1. Alice:\n   * \"Chloe!\"\n      2. Chloe:\n         * \"NEVER!\"\netc.\n\nEvaluation: Wrong Answer.\n\n\nNote that once you know the Recipe has passed through Chloe's hands, it must either be with her or with one of her daughters.\nSample output 5:\nChloe Marie Suzie NEVER Marie NEVER Alice Betty Betty\n\nScore 0.6\n\n\nThis solution is completely equivalent to Sample output 1.\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by:adrian\nDate:2014-03-07\nTime limit:10s\n\t\t\t\nSource limit:50000B\nMemory limit:1536MB\n\nCluster:\n\nCube (Intel G860)\n\n\nLanguages:All except: ASM64 \nResource:Sphere CEBIT Open Challenge 2014 \n",
    "Output": "Your output should describe the strategy you adopt when talking to the witches, with a complete plan of action, stating who to approach in what order, depending on previously obtained answers.\nFirst, print the name of the witch you approach as the first, followed by a list of clauses of the form ANSWER\u00a0->\u00a0FURTHER_ACTION, one clause corresponding to each of the possible answers which may be given by the Witch. For every Witch, you should consider all possible answers the witch may give you, which are feasible given the information you have obtained so far from other Witches. For compactness, assume that in the case when a Witch directs you to her daughter, the ANSWER string\u00a0is simply to be the name of the daughter in question. If the Witch answers that she has no idea of the recipe, the ANSWER string\u00a0should be: NEVER. If a Witch tells you she has the recipe, no further action needs to be taken, and you shoud not write any text corresponding to such an answer in your output file.\u00a0(In particular, if you can be sure that the Witch you have just asked has the recipe, you should not print text corresponding to any answers given by this Witch.) The\u00a0ANSWER\u00a0string\u00a0should be followed by a description of FURTHER_ACTION to take, representing actions which you will subsequently take, subject to the given answer. The FURTHER_ACTION  should be written down following the same grammar rules as those describing the whole of your program's output (i.e., this paragraph is to be read recursively).\u00a0\nWhite spaces (spaces, newlines, and tabs), numbers, and punctuation marks may be inserted arbitrarily into your program's output to improve its formatting; they will be disregarded when testing your solution.

All names of witches are sequences of exactly 5 letters, starting with one upper-case letter (A-Z) and followed by 4 lower-case letters (a-z).

    "Description": "\nAs the Carnival period draws to an end, the remote Kingdom of Byteland is making preparations for the donut feast of Mardi Gras. The King's Court is eagerly anticipating the arrival of notable guests and crowned heads from all round the continent, who will partake of the ceremonial strawberry donut dinner in the Royal Halls. But this year, just before the feast is due to commence, disaster has struck: The Recipe for strawberry donuts, jealously guarded by the Lord Master of the Household, has been destroyed in a kitchen fire caused by an overturned frying pan!\nPanic and dispair have spread through the King's Court. Without The Recipe, noone is able to fry a half-reasonable donut. The one hope of salvation is in an old, almost forgotten legend, which says that in a far-off part of Byteland, there lives a dynasty of Wicked Old Witches, who hold another copy of The Recipe, treasuring it and passing it on from mother to daughter. In a valiant effort to save the face of the Kingdom of Byteland, you set out on an expedition to find the Witches and their strawberry donut Recipe!\nAfter climbing many hills and crossing many seas, you eventually reach a small village in which all of the legendary Witches dwell. The good news is that one copy of the Recipe is still in existance, and is held by one of the living witches. To make things even better, it turns out that the Witches are not as Wicked as the legend states: in fact, they are quite sociable, and may even help you locate the witch who has the Recipe. However, each witch will insist on telling you her life story first, before you can get any useful information out of her. And they are all Old Witches, so it may take a while, and you really don't want to interrupt a Witch when she is talking. Only after a Witch has recounted her countless tales, will she tell you what she knows about the recipe, which will be something along the following lines:\n\n\"The recipe? Oh dear, I'm sorry, I've never seen it myself...\"\u00a0\n\"The recipe? Yes, I do remember... I had it once, many years ago, but I have since passed it on to my most talented daughter (and here comes the name of the daughter in question). Her cooking is so much better than mine, you know!\"\n\"The recipe? But why of course! Here it is. Just make sure you keep it safe!\" (This is the answer you want to hear, but you will only hear it from the one Witch who has the recipe.)\n\nMardi Gras is drawing near, and you may sadly not have enough time to talk to all the charming Old Witches. Try to figure out a way to obtain the recipe, and to do it as quickly as possible!\u00a0"

You can see the scrambles that generated the cubes you've got by clicking your score.\n\u00a0\nInput\nFirst line, you have n<100, the number of cubes to be solved. You will be given n valid scrambled cube position, as in the sample, with default orientation (white on top, green on front).\n\u00a0\nThe cube's faces are represented like:\n\u00a0U\nLFRB\n\u00a0D\n\u00a0\nOuput\nYou have to output the length of your solution, then the solution (at most 1000 face turns). Any valid sequence that solves the cube will be accepted. If you want to skip a particular cube, you have to print \"-1\" instead of the solution length. The penalty for that is 1000 moves, although if you skip all the cases, you will get WA. Every move must be in HTM, without cube rotations or double rotations, i. e., the only accepted moves are {U, F, R, ...} and {U2, U', F2, F', ...}.\n\u00a0\nScore\nScore is the sum of the moves plus penaties.\n\u00a0\nSample Input\n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 W W W\n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 W W W\n \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 O O O\nO O Y G G G W R R B B B\nO O Y G G G W R R B B B\nO O Y G G G W R R B B B\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 R R R\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Y Y Y\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Y Y Y\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 R W G\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 W W W\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 W W O\nG R R B G W B B W O O W\nO O O G G G R R R B B B\nO O O G G G R R R B B B\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Y Y Y\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Y Y Y\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Y Y Y\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 G R B\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 O W G\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 O O G\nW G Y G Y W O R O W W R\nY O O B G G Y R W O B B\nY G R B Y B R W Y B R R\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Y R W\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 W Y B\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 G B O\n3\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 W W W\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 W W W\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 O O O\nO O Y G G G W R R B B B\nO O Y G G G W R R B B B\nO O Y G G G W R R B B B\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 R R R\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Y Y Y\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Y Y Y\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 R W G\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 W W W\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 W W O\nG R R B G W B B W O O W\nO O O G G G R R R B B B\nO O O G G G R R R B B B\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Y Y Y\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Y Y Y\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Y Y Y\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 G R B\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 O W G\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 O O G\nW G Y G Y W O R O W W R\nY O O B G G Y R W O B B\nY G R B Y B R W Y B R R\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Y R W\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 W Y B\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 G B O\n\u00a0\nSample Output\n1\nF'\n7\nR U R' U R U2 R'\n-1\n\u00a0\nSample Score\n1008\n\u00a0\n(1+7+1000)\n\u00a0\nSpecial thanks to Mitch Schwartz, for helping in the custom judge, and Stefan Pochmann, for helping in some glitches.\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandre Henrique Afonso Campos: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-01-06 19:30:25\n\n@David Mili\u00e6evi\u00e6\n\nYou can copy the input from here (Input section) and paste it in a file to help you out.

All former AC submissions were judged using Python 2.5 (as you can conclude from the memory consumption), but now Python 2.7 is running. That really matters, because Python 2.5 offered a - deprecated, but still allowed - possibility that Python 2.7 does no longer accept, but for this problem leads to shorter code. :(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]V[AgN3To: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2015-02-16 14:49:29\n\nwhooa !!\na simple mistake . . .  huh\nfinally AC :)\nLast edit: 2013-03-07 10:23:53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitch Schwartz: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2015-02-16 14:49:29\n\n@]V[AgN3To: I think the given cases are sufficient.

Notice, that You can use the same query more than once.\nIn 2nd test case player asked three times for every single integer. Because Judge can lie only once, the player is able to detect the lie, and choose the value x correctly. The score is 92 = 81.\nIn 3rd test case player decided to skip. Player got the penalty score 4 * 322 = 4096.\nIn 4th test case player tried to give the solution, but the solution is wrong. There is impossible to guess the x value in only two queries. The Judge can reply for example \"YY\" and then x can be 2, 3 or 4. The score is penalty score 4 * 102 = 400.\nIn 5th test case the nubmer of queries given by player is smaller than the maximal possible number.

This mystery is so great, and deals with such important matters, that solving it would surely cause a massive uproar in the communities of archeologists and computer scientists alike. Whole textbooks would have to be rewritten from scratch, from \"Introduction to archeology\" to \"Algorithms and data structures\".\nThat's what Archibald claims, anyway. But most of the scientific world considers him insane since the Rosetta Stone incident (which allegedly contained pseudocode of Dijkstra's algorithm). This time, he claims the existence of previously unknown, ancient South American La-Og-Mhtir civilization - moreover, he has the evidence to support that claim. Their temple, hidden somewhere in the underground of the Amazon rainforests, supposedly contains boundless amounts of ideas, and revealing them would lead to several breakthroughs in computer science. Archibald proposes a bold thesis that even P=NP problem was already solved by this civilization, and the proof (which is elegant and ingenious) can be found somewhere in the heart of their shrine.\nLa-Og-Mhtirs' temple is really well hidden - despite multitude of hints that Archibald found during many years of his studies, he still can't pinpoint its exact location.\nIt looks like this time he is really close, though! During his expedition in the Central Andes in Chile, he found some ancient tablets. There is an inscription above the entrance to the chapel: \"Fastest solution will be found only by the ingenious one\", and it uses very characteristic symbols of the La-Og-Mhtirs' alphabet (which, by sheer luck, has 26 letters, just like the English alphabet).\nArchibald carefully examined two biggest tablets on the inner wall of the chapel. Both contained n rows of letters, and there were n letters in each row. He also found a bizarre mechanism behind the first one! By tinkering with some buttons (made from stone), Archibald can turn any letter on the first tablet into another one from the alphabet - but it takes a long time (n2 hours). After further examination it turned out that another set of buttons can be found near the chapel's ceiling - by using them, it is possible to choose a square-shaped area inside the tablet, and rotate it by 90 degrees (clockwise or counterclockwise) - and it only takes one hour! For no apparent reason, chosen square has to be at least 5 letters wide.\n\nAs an example: in the picture above, by choosing a 5x5 square with top left corner in the second row and the second column of the first tablet, and rotating it counterclockwise, we obtain the second tablet. Rows and columns are numbered from 1 to n, from top to bottom and from left to right.\nFinally, the mystery gradually uncovers itself, right before the Archibald's eyes. Devoting whole life to studying various hints, scattered throughout the world, is starting to pay off. The only thing left to do for Archibald is to use the mechanisms, and make the first tablet look exactly like the second one. More than that - it has to be done as quickly as possible. If La-Og-Mhtirs will deem his solution worthy, the chapel will reveal the location of the Great Temple.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer t, denoting the number of testcases.

The description of a single tablet consists of n lines, each containing n uppercase letters of English alphabet (which correspond to appropriate letters of La-Og-Mhtirs' alphabet). The j-th character in the i-th line describes the i-th row and j-th column of the tablet.\nOutput\nFor each testcase you should find a sequence of moves that will turn the first tablet into the second one.

Then you should output the descriptions of the m moves.\nThe description of one move starts with a string \"Z\", \"OL\", or \"OP\", denoting changing one letter, rotating a square counterclockwise and rotating a square clockwise, respectively. For a \"Z\" move, you should then output two integers r, c and a single character of the English alphabet x (1 <= r,c <= n). It denotes changing the letter in the r-th row and c-th column to x.\nFor a \"OL\" or \"OP\" move, you should then output three integers r, c, q. (1 <= r,c <= n, 5 <= q <= n). It denotes a rotation of the square that is q letters wide, with top left corner in the r-th row and the c-th column.

Both contained n rows of letters, and there were n letters in each row. He also found a bizarre mechanism behind the first one! By tinkering with some buttons (made from stone), Archibald can turn any letter on the first tablet into another one from the alphabet - but it takes a long time (n2 hours). After further examination it turned out that another set of buttons can be found near the chapel's ceiling - by using them, it is possible to choose a square-shaped area inside the tablet, and rotate it by 90 degrees (clockwise or counterclockwise) - and it only takes one hour! For no apparent reason, chosen square has to be at least 5 letters wide.\n\nAs an example: in the picture above, by choosing a 5x5 square with top left corner in the second row and the second column of the first tablet, and rotating it counterclockwise, we obtain the second tablet. Rows and columns are numbered from 1 to n, from top to bottom and from left to right.\nFinally, the mystery gradually uncovers itself, right before the Archibald's eyes. Devoting whole life to studying various hints, scattered throughout the world, is starting to pay off. The only thing left to do for Archibald is to use the mechanisms, and make the first tablet look exactly like the second one. More than that - it has to be done as quickly as possible. If La-Og-Mhtirs will deem his solution worthy, the chapel will reveal the location of the Great Temple."

Raised with the values of his adoptive parents, he feels alienated because of his unique super human abilities.\nBefore the alien planet's destruction Jor-EL was killed by Dru-Zod( also known as General Zod ). Zod was sentenced to exile to the prison of Phantom Zone for his attempts to overtake the planet. Zod somehow managed to escape from his prison and now wants to kill the son of Jor-El i.e. Clark Kent. Now, Zod has reprogrammed the robot army guarding Phantom Zone and is planning to attack Earth starting with the city of Metropolis.\u00a0\nFortunately, CAELOSS ( group of activists that employ electronic communication and super science cybernetics ) issued a warning for the Zod's upcoming attack to the Metropolis citizens. CAELOSS also found that Zod's Robots will be attacking the buildings such that pairwise distance of all buildings under attack is minimum. Clark after getting the information decided to defend his city and himself but he is unable to solve this complex problem of getting the Robot's attack configuration. To make an effective defence startegy he wants someone to give the best approximate result.

    "Description": "\nClark Kent is a young journalist who was born Kal-El on the alien planet before being rocketed to Earth as an infant by his scientist father Jor-El, moments before the planet's destruction and adopted as a child by Jonathan and Martha Kent. Raised with the values of his adoptive parents, he feels alienated because of his unique super human abilities.\nBefore the alien planet's destruction Jor-EL was killed by Dru-Zod( also known as General Zod ). Zod was sentenced to exile to the prison of Phantom Zone for his attempts to overtake the planet. Zod somehow managed to escape from his prison and now wants to kill the son of Jor-El i.e. Clark Kent. Now, Zod has reprogrammed the robot army guarding Phantom Zone and is planning to attack Earth starting with the city of Metropolis.\u00a0\nFortunately, CAELOSS ( group of activists that employ electronic communication and super science cybernetics ) issued a warning for the Zod's upcoming attack to the Metropolis citizens. CAELOSS also found that Zod's Robots will be attacking the buildings such that pairwise distance of all buildings under attack is minimum. Clark after getting the information decided to defend his city and himself but he is unable to solve this complex problem of getting the Robot's attack configuration. To make an effective defence startegy he wants someone to give the best approximate result. No two Robot's will attack the same building.\nPairwise distance in set of N points is defined as :\u00a0\u2211[ distance( A, B) ] for all distinct pairs (A,B) where A and B are points in given set.

Thanks to his connections among other scientists, he can get as many seedlings for his research as he pleases. However, plants need proper conditions in order to grow properly.\nThe best method to ensure that seedlings develop correctly is to place them on specialized shelves, which have proper watering systems, lighting conditions etc. Many different shapes of the shelves are available. Apart from the standard square-shaped 1x1 shelves, it is also possible to obtain shelves that look like this:\n\nEach of the shelves presented above consists of four standard-shaped shelves. Standard shelf can hold one large flowerpot with seedlings. Shelves presented above can hold six flowerpots, thanks to somewhat better use of available space.\nBogdan already bought a room for storing the seedlings - from birds eye view, it looks like a rectangle, n meters high and m meters wide, consisting of square-shaped fields, each 1 meter wide. You can't place the shelves on some of the fields (due to wiring, water supply systems and other stuff) - we consider such fields blocked. There is a door on the wall above the field in the top left corner - it opens inward, so we can't place anything on this field either. Bogdan plans to fit as many flowerpots in the room as possible, by placing shelves on the remaining fields. Moreover, he wants to do it in such a way that the square-shaped segments of the shelves exactly cover the fields in the room.\nHis research demands constant access to plants - every shelf must be accessible by walking on non-blocked fields, starting from the field with the door. You can walk between two fields if they share a common edge.\nHelp Bogdan! Place the shelves according to the rules, to fit as many flowerpots in the room as possible.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer t, denoting the number of testcases. (t <= 10). Then, testcases follow.\nThe description of a single testcase begins with two integers n, m (1 <= n, m <= 50) - height and width of the rectangle representing the room. Then, n lines follow, each containing m characters. j-th character in i-th line denotes a square in i-th row nad j-th column. \".\" (a dot) denotes free square, \"X\" denotes blocked square. Field in the top left corner is always free.\nOutput\nFor every testcase you should find an arrangement of shelves that satisfies the rules from the problem statement. The descriptions begins with two integers p and d (1 <= p <= n*m) - number of shelves and number of flowerpots on the shelves, respectively. Then, the descriptions of p shelves should follow. Each shelf is described by four integers wi, ki, ri and oi (1 <= wi <= n, 1 <= ki <= m, 0 <= ri <= 7, 0 <= oi <= 3) - it means that the anchor point of the i-th shelf is in the row number wi and column number ki, the shelf is of type ri, and is rotated oi times 90 degrees to the right, starting from the configuration on the picture. Anchor point of every shape is in the top left corner in the picture (and it is in the same segment after the rotation).

Then, n lines follow, each containing m characters. j-th character in i-th line denotes a square in i-th row nad j-th column. \".\" (a dot) denotes free square, \"X\" denotes blocked square. Field in the top left corner is always free.",
    "Description": "\nOriginal problem statement (in Polish) can be found here.\nBogdan the Botanist is conducting research on a certain species of plant, which supposedly have some miraculous healing properties. Thanks to his connections among other scientists, he can get as many seedlings for his research as he pleases. However, plants need proper conditions in order to grow properly.\nThe best method to ensure that seedlings develop correctly is to place them on specialized shelves, which have proper watering systems, lighting conditions etc. Many different shapes of the shelves are available. Apart from the standard square-shaped 1x1 shelves, it is also possible to obtain shelves that look like this:\n\nEach of the shelves presented above consists of four standard-shaped shelves. Standard shelf can hold one large flowerpot with seedlings. Shelves presented above can hold six flowerpots, thanks to somewhat better use of available space.\nBogdan already bought a room for storing the seedlings - from birds eye view, it looks like a rectangle, n meters high and m meters wide, consisting of square-shaped fields, each 1 meter wide. You can't place the shelves on some of the fields (due to wiring, water supply systems and other stuff) - we consider such fields blocked. There is a door on the wall above the field in the top left corner - it opens inward, so we can't place anything on this field either. Bogdan plans to fit as many flowerpots in the room as possible, by placing shelves on the remaining fields. Moreover, he wants to do it in such a way that the square-shaped segments of the shelves exactly cover the fields in the room.\nHis research demands constant access to plants - every shelf must be accessible by walking on non-blocked fields, starting from the field with the door. You can walk between two fields if they share a common edge.\nHelp Bogdan! Place the shelves according to the rules, to fit as many flowerpots in the room as possible."

Correct answers are awarded a score. Where is that mentioned in the question?\n\n=(Francky)=> There's about 30 input files, and for each one one single input number. Just focus on one input number. Your program need to read only one number, and write only one answer.\n2s is for each input file. The AC solvers are given the total time, that can reach near 30\u00d72s = 60s at max.

    "Description": "\n \nNalin really loves music, just like her father. When she was a child, she got keyboard classes at a private school.

She searched for the song Endless Love over the internet to learn how to play it, but, unfortunately, the tone wasn't good enough for her to sing. If it was a keyboard, she could just hit a button and the problem would be solved, but there's no such button in a piano. She began to make the tone transposition with a paper and a pen, but it was taking too long, then she asked her husband to write her a program to do it, without telling him what was it for.\nIf you want to know a little bit more about tone transposition, in order to solve the problem, please read the end of problem statement.\nInput In each test cases, first line is n<=1000 and in the next line, a number t, -12<=t<=+12.

Santa Claus, who own this factory want to deliver this toys as a gift to many children who want some gift on christmas day using flying reindeer, because for each year number of toy increase and his flying reindeer get older, he want his load to be as light as possible.\nFortunately this christmas (December 2014) he invent a new technology that can store infinite amount of toys using 4th space dimension, he call it \"magical box\", so every item/toys in magical box will weightless, very impressive! He invent that magical box on 23 December 2014, there still 2 days remaining before christmas, so he want to speed up the loading process.\nThere are many toys to load in short time and his magical box can't absorb many obcect to 4th space dimension in short time, so he decided to split the work in parallel because he has many magical box available. For example if the toys numbered from 1 to n\u00a0first magical box absorb toy 2 to toy 5, ... , last magical box absorb toy n-7 to n-1. Note that it's possible that Santa's magical box can't absorb all toys in his factory on time even if he use parallel technique, so some toy maybe left in the factory for next christmas.\nBecause his magical box still in \"beta version\" it still has a bug, it can only absorb consecutive toys only, so if toys 3 and toys 5 absorbed to same magical box, toy 4 will be accidentally absorbed to that magical box too. Since the problem become too complex, Santa want to rest and he left the factory to feed and tell his flying reindeer a good news that he invent the magical box so his flying reindeer will not carrying heavy load again like previous year. He also planning how he pack the toys to magical box. Because Santa is perfection, he want each box if used contains at least d toys.\nNow he wonder how many ways he can load the toys into his magical box if number of his magical box and number of toys in his factory is same. It's not necessary to use all his magical box, he want to use at least one of his magical box. Can you help him count how many ways he can do it?",

Santa Claus, pemilik dari pabrik tersebut ingin mengirimkan mainan-mainan ini sebagai hadiah kepada banyak anak-anak yang menginginkan hadiah di hari natal menggunakan rusa terbang, karena setiap tahunnya jumlah mainan yang diproduksi meningkat dan rusa tgerbangnya semakin tua, ia ingin barang bawaannya seringan mungkin.\nBerungtung pada natal kali ini (Desember 2014) ia berhasil menciptakan teknologi yang dapat menyimpan mainan dengan jumlah tanpa batas, ia menamakan ciptaannya itu \"Kotak Ajaib\", jadi setiap mainan dalam kotak ajaib tidak akan memiliki berat, sungguh hebat! Ia menciptakan kotak ajaib pada tanggal 23 Desember 2014, ada sisa 2 hari lagi menjelang natal, jadi ia ingin mempercepat proses pemasukan barangnya.\nAda banyak mainan yang harus dimasukkan dalam waktu singkat dan kotak ajaib tidak dapat menghisap banyak mainan dalam waktu singkat, jadi ia memutuskan untuk memasukkan mainan ke dalam beberapa kotak ajaib secara bersamaan. Misalkan jika mainan diberi nomor dari 1 hingga n, maka salah satu kemungkinannya adalah kotak ajaib pertama diisi mainan ke_2 hingga mainan ke_5, ... , kotak ajaib terakhir diisi mainan ke_n-7 hingga mainan ke_n-1. Perhatikan bahwa ada kemungkinan kotak ajaibnya Santa tidak dapat menghisap semua mainan di pabriknya dengan tepat waktu meskipun ia menggunakan beberapa kotak ajaib secara bersamaan, jadi beberapa mainan mungkin tertinggal di pabrik untuk natal berikutnya.\nKarena kotak ajaib masih dalam \"versi percobaan\", kemampuan kotak ajaibnya belum sempurna dan masih terdapat beberapa kekurangan dalam fungsinya, salah satu kekurangan yang paling parah adalah kotaknya hanya bisa menghisap mainan yang berurutan saja, misalnya jika mainan nomor 3 dan nomor 5 dimasukkan kedalam kotak ajaib yang sama, mainan nomor 4 mau tidak mau pasti juga akan terhisap ke dalam kotak itu. Karena masalahnya menjadi terlalu rumit, maka Santa ingin beristirahat dan meninggalkan pabriknya sejenak untuk memberi makan dan memberitahu rusa terbangnya kabar gembira bahwa ia berhasil menciptakan kotak ajaib sahingga rusa terbangnya tidak perlu mengangkut beban yang berat lagi seperti tahun lalu. Ia juga merencanakan bagaimana urutan pemasukkan mainan ke dalam kotak ajaib. Karena Santa ingin segalanya sempurna, maka ia ingin agar setiap kotak ajaib jika digunakan berisi setidaknya d mainan.\nSekarang ia penasaran ada berapa banyak cara ia dapat memasukkan mainan ke dalam kotak ajaibnya jika jumlah kotak ajaib sama dengan jumlah mainan di pabriknya. Tidak selalu semua kotak ajaibnya digunakan, ia hanya ingin menggunakan setidaknya satu kotak ajaib. Dapatkah anda membatunya menghitung berapa banyak cara ia dapat melakukannya?\nFormat Masukan\nPada baris pernama, terdapat satu bilangan bulat c yang melambangkan jenis berkas masukan.

    "Description": "\nCombinational logic circuits are part of all modern CPUs and other electronic means of information processing. These processors are widely used and constantly grow in complexity. Number of transistors in a modern CPU has exceeded 2 billion?. And it looks like this growth does not tend to stop.

Now TT means \"total number of tests\". Now \"trash gate\" scenario doesn't work, but the difference between solutions became smaller.\n\nAll soultions were rejudjed.\nLast edit: 2015-02-09 12:53:25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman Sol: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2015-02-16 14:11:35\n\nFlago, thank you now I get it ) I probably will change the judge to avoid this. Need to think how to make it. Probably I should consider floating nodes as outputs also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlago: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2015-02-16 14:11:35\n\n@Roman Sol : Nope, changing the seed might give you some (very) little changes on score but it won't give those result just by adding trash gates. I will give you a concrete exemple of the \"trash gate abuse\".\n\nLet our exemple have the following input :\n1\n2\nINV 50 20.0\n...\n1 a\n1 c\nINV a b\nINV b c\n\nSo it is just a simple : [ a ==(INV)==> b ==(INV)==> c ], with 20% fail on each gate.\n\n\n\nLet be our first solution the same circuit :\nINV a b (gate A)\nINV b c (gate B)\n\nWe have 4 possibilities with the following odds :\n4% all fails, taken in count, correct output.\n32% A or B fails, taken in count, incorrect output.\n64% no fails, NOT taken in count.\n\nOur score for that solution will be ( 0.36 - 0.32 ) / 0.36 = 0.111\n\n\n\n\nNow, let add a trash gate to the solution ! Being the circuit :\nINV a b (gate A)\nINV b c (gate B)\nINV a t (gate T)\n\nWe have 8 posibilities with the following odds :\n0.8% all fails, taken in count, correct output.\n3.2% A and B fails, taken in count, correct output.\n6.4% A and T or B and T fails, taken in count, incorrect output.\n12.8% T fails, taken in count, correct output (This one is the scam !).\n25.6% A or B fails, taken in count, incorrect output.\n51.2% No fails, NOT taken in count.\n\nOur score for that solution will be ( 0.488 - 0.256 - 0.064 ) / 0.488 = 0.344 !!\nOur score was improved just by cheating the score system, not improving the reliability what so ever.\n\n\n\nWon't do the calculations, but we could improve futher more our score by adding yet another trash gate, and so on until the space is missing.\n\nFor information, my \"best\" score was obtained mainly by outputing the same circuit with a bunch of added trash gates. And changing some really little things just to gain the last decimal to get #1 :s \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoman Sol: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2015-02-16 14:11:35\n\nFlago, actually I don't get it. Why you recieve better score with trash gates? If you don't have these gates you get correct or incorrect as well. And the probability of error of \"usefull\" gates stays the same. And the error flag set indpendently for any gate. So I think trash gates only can violate \"seed\" value for random generator. And you get better score not because of trash invertors, but because of random generator generates other values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlago: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2015-02-16 14:11:35\n\nEnjoyed this problem.\n\n@Problem setter : The score is however really poorly calculated. Taking in count only the number of test case where you had at least 1 failing gate make it abusable, for exemple, adding a bunch of \"trash\" gates at the end of you circuit like this (where \"a\" is any node of your circuit) : \n\nINV a im_le_trash_gate_0\nINV a im_le_trash_gate_1\nINV a im_le_trash_gate_2\n... (while you have the area to add more gates) \n\nIn a case that none of your legit gates fail but at least one of the trash gates does, the result is taking in count as correct case while it was not taking in count previously, improving your score without any improve on your output reliability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by:Roman Sol\nDate:2014-08-08\nTime limit:50s\n\t\t\t\nSource limit:50000B\nMemory limit:1536MB\n\nCluster:\n\nCube (Intel G860)\n\n\nLanguages:All except: ASM64 \n\n"

He's not only great at traditional chess, but also its different variants. Chinese chess, Japanese chess, hexagonal chess - it doesn't matter, he never lost a game in his life. Unfortunately it means that no one really likes to play with him, so he has to somehow entertain himself.\nThis time he came up with a following puzzle. There is a generalized chess board, with n rows and n columns. Rows are numbered starting with 1, top to bottom. Columns a numbered starting with 1, left to right. There are kings on some of the squares. You have to place some of your pieces on the empty squares, such that you check every king. (King is said to be in check, if given current state of the board there exists a move that would capture the king - we always assume it's our turn, so movement of the kings does not matter at all.) You can use the following pieces, from different chess variants, with different costs:\n\n bishop (chess) - can move any number of squares diagonally (in four directions). Its movement is stopped by pieces that are already on the board (so it can only capture the first obstacle on his way).\n rook (chess) - can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically, otherwise analogous to a bishop.\n knight (chess) - can make two squares horizontally and one vertically, or two squares vertically and one horizontally, an L-shaped move (8 possibilities). It ignores any pieces in its way.\ngolden general (shogi) - can move into any of 8 neighboring squares, with two exceptions: it can't move diagonally backwards to the left or to the right (\"backwards\" means in the direction o increasing row numbers).\n silver general (shogi) - can move into any of 8 neighboring squares, with three exceptions: it can't move directly to the left (the direction of decreasing columns), directly to the right or directly backwards.\n horse (shogi) - can move just like bishop, and additionally it can move into any of 8 neighboring squares.\n phoenix (dai shogi) - can move one square horizontally or vertically (4 possibilities), or two squares diagonally (4 possibilities), 8 possibilities in total. Like knight, it ignores pieces standing in its way.\n cannon (xiangqi) - can move just like rook, but in order to capture a piece, there must be exactly one other piece on the way between the cannon and the captured piece (doesn't matter to which player it belongs). Cannon jumps over that piece without capturing it.\n\nWhen in doubt, please consult movement rules from the original games (they are unchanged). Caution: horse from shogi is a promoted bishop, and NOT a promoted rook (ry\u016bma, not ry\u016b\u014d).\nPlease help Simon with his arbitrary problem - find an arrangement of pieces that checks all of the kings, with the minimum possible sum of costs.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer t <= 15, denoting number of testcases. Then, testcases follow.\nFirst line of the testcase contains one integer n (2 <= n <= 25) - board size. Then, n lines follow, each containing n characters. j-th character in the i-th line corresponds to chessboard square from the i-th row and j-th column - if it's \"#\", the square contains a king. If it's \"_\", square is empty. For every square with a king, at least one of the 8 neighboring squares is empty.\nIn the last line of the testcase there are 8 integers xi (1 <= xi <= 106) - costs of chess pieces, in the order like in the problem description.\nOutput\nFor every testcase you should output two integers: f and g (1 <= f <= n2, 1 <= g) - number of pieces in your solution, and the total cost. Then you should produce a description of f pieces.\nDescription of one piece consists of three integers x, w, k (1 <= x <= 8, 1 <= w, k <= n) - type of piece (number as in the problem description), row number and column number.

Nobody knows exactly what purpose do they serve, but that doesn't stop him from having fun.\nThis time, specially trained hamster is the object of research for Bronis\u0142aw. Scientists from his group have built an incredibly complicated racetrack made of transparent plastic - it consists of n nodes and m tunnels connecting those nodes. Tunnels have colours - some are red, some are green, others are striped red and green. Also, every tunnel has arrows painted on, denoting the direction of movement.\nThe experiment is as follows: hamster is dropped into the racetrack through one of the nodes. Then, he runs through the tunnels to his liking - he is specially trained to respect the direction of arrows. Moreover, at the very beginning he chooses a colour - red or green - and uses only the tunnels that have this colour (even if it's only partially).\nBronis\u0142aw has a problem though. Hamster is incredibly stubborn - once he enters the racetrack, he will run without stopping, until he reaches a node where there is no way to choose a tunnel with colour he picked.

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMATE - Materializer\n\n\nno tags\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nOriginal problem statements can be found here: in Polish and in English.\nChef Christopher just made his dream come true. He opened a company that produces custom-made cookie cutters. First customers already placed their orders (not all of the shapes are suitable for cookie cutters, but oh well - customer is always right).\nChristopher bought a special machine - Materializer 3000. It can produce any given three-dimensional shape, you have to program it beforehand though.\nEvery order consists of a layers. Every layer is a table of cubes with edge length 1, with b rows and c columns. For every cube customer specifies whether he wants it filled or not. Layers are numbered starting with 1, lowest to highest, row starting with 1 and top to bottom, and columns starting with 1, left to right.\nMaterializer works as follows: at the start, specialized part of the machine (called extruder) is on the first layer, first row and first column. Extruder can move around, and fill any cube with a special material. First layer is at the very bottom - a shape is produced starting from the bottom towards the top. Extruder can move freely within a layer, but after moving up a layer it can't go lower again.\nMaterializer accepts the following commands, and executes them in sequence:\n\n M x y - move the extruder by x columns and y rows. ( x,y from {-1,0,1} ),\n N - move the extruder up a layer,\n E - fill the current cube with material,\n C - end.\n\nTo produce a stable shape, you have to satisfy some requirements. A cube on layer w, in column x and row y can be filled with material only if at the time of executing \"E\" command one of the following conditions is true:\n\n  w = 1  (extruder is on the first layer),\n cube in the position  (w-1, x, y)  is already filled,\n there exists a sequence of positions  (x,y) = (x0,y0) , (x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn) such that:\n\n 1 <= n <= k,\n for i >= 1 it is true that |xi-1-xi| + |yi-1-yi| = 1,\n for i >= 1, cube in the postition  (w, xi, yi)  is filled,\n cube in the position (w-1, xn, yn) is filled.\n\n\nIt's possible that you can't fulfill a given order without violating those constraints. To deal with this, you can produce additional cubes (acting as a \"scaffolding\"), and then remove it. Please help Chris - find a sequence of move that will produce given orders quickly, without wasting too much material.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer t <= 7, denoting number of testcases. Then, testcases follow.\nFirst line of the testcase consist of four integers c, b, a, k (1 <= c, b, a <= 30, 1 <= k <= 3) - dimensions of the given order and the stability coefficient. Then, layers follow.\nDescription of a layer consist of b lines. Every line is a string of length c. Character in the line number y and column x corresponds to a cube in x-th column and y-th row - \"#\" denotes that cube has to be filled, \"_\" means that this cube may remain empty.\nOutput\nFor every testcase you should output a sequence of moves that fills out all cubes specified in the order.

    "Input": "The first line contains a single integer t <= 7, denoting number of testcases. Then, testcases follow.\nFirst line of the testcase consist of four integers c, b, a, k (1 <= c, b, a <= 30, 1 <= k <= 3) - dimensions of the given order and the stability coefficient. Then, layers follow.\nDescription of a layer consist of b lines. Every line is a string of length c. Character in the line number y and column x corresponds to a cube in x-th column and y-th row - \"#\" denotes that cube has to be filled, \"_\" means that this cube may remain empty.",
    "Description": "\nOriginal problem statements can be found here: in Polish and in English.\nChef Christopher just made his dream come true. He opened a company that produces custom-made cookie cutters. First customers already placed their orders (not all of the shapes are suitable for cookie cutters, but oh well - customer is always right).\nChristopher bought a special machine - Materializer 3000. It can produce any given three-dimensional shape, you have to program it beforehand though.\nEvery order consists of a layers. Every layer is a table of cubes with edge length 1, with b rows and c columns. For every cube customer specifies whether he wants it filled or not. Layers are numbered starting with 1, lowest to highest, row starting with 1 and top to bottom, and columns starting with 1, left to right.\nMaterializer works as follows: at the start, specialized part of the machine (called extruder) is on the first layer, first row and first column. Extruder can move around, and fill any cube with a special material. First layer is at the very bottom - a shape is produced starting from the bottom towards the top. Extruder can move freely within a layer, but after moving up a layer it can't go lower again.\nMaterializer accepts the following commands, and executes them in sequence:\n\n M x y - move the extruder by x columns and y rows. ( x,y from {-1,0,1} ),\n N - move the extruder up a layer,\n E - fill the current cube with material,\n C - end.\n\nTo produce a stable shape, you have to satisfy some requirements. A cube on layer w, in column x and row y can be filled with material only if at the time of executing \"E\" command one of the following conditions is true:\n\n  w = 1  (extruder is on the first layer),\n cube in the position  (w-1, x, y)  is already filled,\n there exists a sequence of positions  (x,y) = (x0,y0) , (x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn) such that:\n\n 1 <= n <= k,\n for i >= 1 it is true that |xi-1-xi| + |yi-1-yi| = 1,\n for i >= 1, cube in the postition  (w, xi, yi)  is filled,\n cube in the position (w-1, xn, yn) is filled.\n\n\nIt's possible that you can't fulfill a given order without violating those constraints. To deal with this, you can produce additional cubes (acting as a \"scaffolding\"), and then remove it. Please help Chris - find a sequence of move that will produce given orders quickly, without wasting too much material."

One episode has the following plot.Professor Farnsworth switches bodies with Amy using a new invention so that he can relive his youth. Likewise, Amy is reminiscent of her younger days of constantly eating and wishes to use the Professor's skinny body to gorge herself with food once again. Later, they find they cannot switch their bodies back with each other, because the device will not operate on the same pairing of bodies. The Professor thoughtlessly suggests they might be able to switch back to their original bodies with a third person. Bender switches bodies with the Professor (Amy's body) so he can perform a robbery without being identified. After realizing his mistake, the Professor, now in Bender's body, tires of trying to solve the problem. He decides to live a life of daring stunts and joins a robot circus.\nBender, now in Amy's body, is caught aboard the yacht of Robo-Hungarian emperor Nikolai. When Bender states that he is really a robot who has switched bodies with a human, Nikolai reveals that he feels trapped by his wealth and wishes to live the life of a normal, \"peasant\" robot. Bender tricks him into switching bodies with a robot wash bucket and inhabits Nikolai's body, planning to live like an emperor. However, he discovers that Nikolai's fianc\u00e9e and first officer are plotting to kill him. Bender is saved with the assistance of the Professor and the circus' loyal Robo-Hungarian citizens. Meanwhile, Leela switches bodies with Amy, thus inhabiting the Professor's body, when she comes to believe that Fry only loves her for her beauty. In order to beat Leela at her own game, Fry switches bodies with Dr. Zoidberg in an attempt to repulse Leela. This leads them to one-up each other using various disgusting acts while on a date, which climaxes when the two have sex with each other in their equally grotesque bodies, and reconcile. During this time, Amy has overeaten in Leela's body, making it overweight. She switches bodies with Hermes, so she can continue eating while Hermes slims Leela's body back down. While eating, she witnesses Fry and Leela making out in the Professor and Dr. Zoidberg's bodies and loses her appetite for food. Concurrently, Zoidberg and Nikolai, in the respective bodies of Fry and the robot wash bucket, become friends and attempt to assume the lives of Fry and Bender, blowing up their apartment in the process. The bucket, now in Amy's body, professes its love to Scruffy the Janitor, but he turns it away. Finally, two Globetrotters, Ethan \"Bubblegum\" Tate and \"Sweet\" Clyde Dixon, mathematically prove that everyone's minds can be restored using two additional bodies and then successfully do so, with themselves as the extras.We need to replicate how they have accomplished this. We will consider that a certain amount of body switches already took place. We need to determine the sequence of switches after which everyone is in self body, using no more than two extra bodies. Don't forget that two specific bodies can be mind switched only once.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains t - the number of test cases. The description of tests follows. The first line of each test is numbers n - the numbre of characters and m - the number of body swtiches already taken place. Next m lines contain the description of switches. Let us mark all bodies with numbers from 1 to n. Then each switch is defined by two numbers a, b - the numbers of bodies used in the switch. The switches are listed chronologically.\n\nConstraints\n1 <= t <= 50\n2 <= n <= 200\n1 <= m <= n(n-1)/2\n1 <= a, b <= n\n\nOutput\nPrint the number of switches needed to return everyone to their own bodies in the first line of the output. Then you should print the switches themselves in the order they should be performed. The format should be the same as in the input data. You can output any valid solution. However you shouldn't use more than two extra bodies. The extra bodies should be marked as n+1 and n+2. After all the switches the extra characters should be in their own bodies as well. Also you can't use more than 3n swtiches.\n\nScoring\nFor each test case you score will be the amount of switches. Moreover if you use only one extra body your score will be 0.9 multiplied by the amount of swtiches. If no extra bodies used - 0.8*<amount of switches>. The score for the problem will be the sum of the scores of individual test cases.\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n2 1\n1 2\n\nOutput:\n5\n1 3\n2 4\n2 3\n1 4\n3 4\n\nThe score of such solution will be 5.\n\n\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by:Spooky\nDate:2010-11-28\nTime limit:0.304s\n\t\t\t\nSource limit:50000B\nMemory limit:1536MB\n\nCluster:\n\nCube (Intel G860)\n\n\nLanguages:All except: ASM64 \n\n",

As a result, one side of a stack of pancakes is often burned. Clearly, it is bad business to serve visibly burned pancakes to the patrons. Before serving, the waitress will arrange the stacks of pancakes so that the burned sides are facing down. You must write a program to aid the waitress in stacking the pancakes correctly.\n\nWe start with a stack of N pancakes of distinct sizes, each of which is burned on one side. The problem is to convert the stack to one in which the pancakes are in size order with the smallest on the top and the largest on the bottom and burned side down for each pancake. To do this, we are allowed to flip the top k pancakes over as a unit (so the k-th pancake is now on top and the pancake previously on top is now in the k-th position and the burned side goes from top to bottom and vice versa).\n\nFor example (+ indicates burned bottom, - a burned top):\n\n+1 -3 -2 [flip 2] \u21d2 +3 -1 -2 [flip 1] \u21d2 -3 -1 -2 [flip 3] \u21d2\n+2 +1 +3 [flip 1] \u21d2 -2 +1 +3 [flip 2] \u21d2 -1 +2 +3 [flip 1] \u21d2 +1 +2 +3\n\nYou must write a program which finds a sequence of flips, which converts a given stack of pancakes to a sorted stack with burned sides down.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer N < 55, the number of problem instances to follow. Each of the following N lines gives a separate dataset as a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. The first number on each line gives the number M of pancakes in the data set. The remainder of the data set is the numbers 1 through M in some order, each with a plus or minus sign, giving the initial pancake stack. The numbers indicate the relative sizes of the pancakes and the signs indicate whether the burned side is up (-) or down (+). M will be, at most, 1000.\n\nOutput\nFor each dataset, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The number of flips (K, where 0 <= K <= 3000) required to sort the pancakes and a sequence of K numbers, each of which gives the number of pancakes to flip on the corresponding sorting step.

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEYES - Robo Eye\n\n\n#bubble-cup-6-round-2\n\n\n\n\n A robot which helps to translate old papers into digital format is being prepared for mass production. But it requires special software to work efficiently.  All scans which will be analyzed by the robot use one of the standard fonts: Arial, Courier, or Times New Roman. As the press is not ideal and pages can be rotated, some of the scans will be rotated by some degree. Imperfections of the robot's camera (\"eye\") can also cause some noise. Uniform noise can be up to 2% of the number of pixels. All analyzed documents are in uppercase English. The total number of letters in the robot's eye ranges from 3 to 6. The matrix in the robot's eye is monochrome and its size is 200x200 pixels.\n\nInput\nt \u2013 the number of tests [t <= 500], then t tests follows.\nEach test consists of 200 rows with 200 chars in each of them. Characters can be '.' and 'X', where '.' means the white color of the page, and 'X' is the black color of words.\nThe input data was generated using an on-line generator. The generator outputs data in 2 formats:\n1) as a picture\n2) as text\nThe datasets used for testing are such that all letters of the word are contained inside the picture.\nOutput\nFor each test output the recognized word in a separate line.\n\nScore\nThe number of points you\u2019ll receive for each image will be equal to the number of letters of the word, provided that it is correctly recognized.\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n...........X...........X..............................................................X.................................................................................................................\n.............................................X...........................X......................X.........................................X...............................................X.............\n........................................................................................X...............................................................................................................\nX............X....X...............................................................................................................X......X..................X......X.......................X..X.........\n.........................................................X.........X.............................X.........................X.....XXX........X................................X..........................\n................X.................................X...X....X......X.........................X...................................XXXXX.........................X.........................................\n..............................X.X...........X.......................................................X......X....X.........X....XXXXXXX.........................................X........X...............\n..............................................X...................................................................X..X.........XXXXXXXX.................................................................\n......................................................................................................................X..........XXXXXXX................................................................\n.....................................................................X............................................................XXXXXXX.......X......................X................................\n...................................................X...........................X.....X...........X........X........................XXXXXXX...........................X..................................\n.......................X...............................................................X............................................XXXXXXX.......................X...X.................................\n.........X.................................................................................................X......X..................XXXXXXX.......................................................X....\n.............X.........X.............................................X.....X...X.............X........................................XXXXXXXX...........................X...............X..............\n...X....................................X.........................................................................................X....XXXXXXXX.........................................................\n......................................X..........X...................................................................................X..XXXXXXXX.......................X................................\n...........................................................................X.............................................................XXXXXXXX.......................................................\n.....................................................X..X.........................................X.................XX...........X........XXXXXXXX......X.....................................X.........\n......................X............................................................................................XXXXXXX.................XXXXXXXX....XX.................X.............................\n....................X...........................................................................X..............X..XXXXXXXXXXXXX.............XXXXXXXX......X.....................X.......................\n................................................................X................................................XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.........XXXXXXXX...............X...................................\n.............................................................................X......X..............X..............XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.....XXXXXXXX..........X.......................X...............\n......................X...........X.............X.............X....................................................XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX..XXXXXXXX..............................................X..\n....................................................................................................................XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX....................................X...........\n.X...................X.............................................................X.................................

All scans which will be analyzed by the robot use one of the standard fonts: Arial, Courier, or Times New Roman. As the press is not ideal and pages can be rotated, some of the scans will be rotated by some degree. Imperfections of the robot's camera (\"eye\") can also cause some noise. Uniform noise can be up to 2% of the number of pixels. All analyzed documents are in uppercase English. The total number of letters in the robot's eye ranges from 3 to 6. The matrix in the robot's eye is monochrome and its size is 200x200 pixels.\n"

As a result, one side of a stack of pancakes is often burned. Clearly, it is bad business to\nserve visibly burned pancakes to the patrons. Before serving, the waitress will arrange the stacks of\npancakes so that the burned sides are facing down. You must write a program to aid the waitress in\nstacking the pancakes correctly.\nWe start with a stack of N pancakes of distinct sizes, each of which is burned on one side. The\nproblem is to convert the stack to one in which the pancakes are in size order with the smallest on the\ntop and the largest on the bottom and burned side down for each pancake. To do this, we are\nallowed to flip the top k pancakes over as a unit (so the k-th pancake is now on top and the pancake\npreviously on top is now in the k-th position and the burned side goes from top to bottom and vice\nversa).\nFor example (+ indicates burned bottom, - a burned top):\n               +1 -3 -2 [flip 2] \u21d2 +3 -1 -2 [flip 1] \u21d2 -3 -1 -2 [flip 3] \u21d2\n         +2 +1 +3 [flip 1] \u21d2 -2 +1 +3 [flip 2] \u21d2 -1 +2 +3 [flip 1] \u21d2 +1 +2 +3\n\nYou must write a program which finds a sequence of at most (3n \u2013 2) flips, which converts a given\nstack of pancakes to a sorted stack with burned sides down.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single decimal integer, N, the number of problem instances to\nfollow. Each of the following N lines gives a separate dataset as a sequence of numbers separated\nby spaces. The first number on each line gives the number, M, of pancakes in the data set. The\nremainder of the data set is the numbers 1 through M in some order, each with a plus or minus sign,\ngiving the initial pancake stack. The numbers indicate the relative sizes of the pancakes and the\nsigns indicate whether the burned side is up (-) or down (+). M will be, at most, 30.\n\nOutput\nFor each dataset, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The dataset\nnumber as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space, the number of flips (K, where K >= 0)\nrequired to sort the pancakes and a sequence of K numbers, each of which gives the number of\npancakes to flip on the corresponding sorting step. There may be several correct solutions for some\ndatasets. For instance 3 2 3 is also a solution to the first problem below.\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n3 +1 \u20133 \u20132\n4 \u20133 +1 \u20132 \u20134\n5 +1 +2 +3 +4 -5\n\nOutput:\n1 6 2 1 3 1 2 1\n2 6 4 1 4 3 1 2\n3 3 5 1 5\n\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndarryl: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2011-08-20 14:34:17\n\nthe minus sign in sample input is not in plain ascii.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by:Marco Gallotta\nDate:2008-03-11\nTime limit:10.90s\n\t\t\t\nSource limit:50000B\nMemory limit:1536MB\n\nCluster:\n\nCube (Intel G860)\n\n\nLanguages:All except: ERL JS-RHINO NODEJS PERL6 VB.NET \nResource:ACM Greater New York Regionals 2007 \n",

(this is not the time limit, this is fixed on every problem). You can clearly see that on this problem the output can be large, and checking the solution is harder than just reading it.\n\nThough it could be other problem. You could try to solve only say every 10-th line from the input files, in other lines just print '\\n' to see if it is the problem. (and in this case you get a small but positive score).\n\nThe judge works a lot also on my best code, but I haven't got an internal error.\n\nYou could try to solve only the test file with 100 cases. Just checked that my code solves it perfectly, maybe this is not a luck, and the input is the same what is in the easy version of this problem. (in this case you can get 100 points).\nLast edit: 2012-12-01 15:46:16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\u00e9la M\u00e9rvad\u00f3: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2012-12-06 06:27:15\n\nhai\n\ni'm getting internal errors. can you please check if it's mah codes fault?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeroen Bransen: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2012-12-06 06:27:15\n\nThere also seems to be a problem with the score calculation. When attempting to solve more testcases my score has gone down, while I am sure that I only replaced empty lines by non-empty lines. This should either give a runtime error or the score should be the same or go up.\n\nRe( Author ) : I think my custom judge is ignoring TLE. It seems you are getting time limit exceeded on 4th test file. So score for that file is not getting added to your total score. I'll try to find a way out of it.\nLast edit: 2012-03-24 18:52:13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeroen Bransen: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2012-12-06 06:27:15\n\nAre you sure the input data is formatted correctly?

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAR - Markov Algorithm\n\n\nno tags\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nMarkov schemes are well known field of study in theory of algorithms. Let's define some slightly simplified schemes. We have some character set (alphabet), and a string composed of these symbols. Besides, we have rules of replacement, and each rule specifies the substring to be replaced and the replacement string. The replacement string can be empty. The order of rules is fixed. Everything functions as follows. Rules are looked through in input order. The first rule which can be applied, is applied exactly once (the given replacement which is described by the rule is carried out), and then the operation cycle repeats (the list is looked through anew). If there are many substrings in the line which satisfy a given rule then only the first (i.e., the leftmost) will be replaced. The process comes to an end if after the last rule application the line has not changed. During the process of replacements the length of the initial string can change, increasing or decreasing. \nExample:\nLet\u2019s consider the string ababaab\nand the set of rules\nab->c\ncc->ab\nAs a result of the application of rules the initial string will be transformed into \u201ccac\u201d. The following intermediate results will appear: ababaab, cabaab, ccaab, ccac, abac, cac.\n\nThat\u2019s all. And now some tasks.\nTask 1: The initial non-empty string was obtained from an ordinary arithmetic formula by the deletion of every symbol except brackets. You are to write the set of rules which transforms this string into the string \"RIGHT\" or \"WRONG\" depending on the correctness of brackets positions, following rules of bracket use in arithmetical expressions. For example, the string ()((())()) must be replaced by the string RIGHT, while the string (() must be replaced by the string WRONG with the same replacement rules.\nTask 2: The initial string represents an arbitrary string of the following type [integer1]+[integer2]=?, where [integer1] and [integer2] are decimal representation of some positive integers. You are to write a set of rules which translates the initial string into a string of the following type: [integer1]+[integer2]=[sum], where [sum] is the decimal representation of the sum of two numbers integer1 and integer2. For example, the string 2+2=? must be replaced by 2+2=4, and the string 25+76=? must be replaced by 25+76=101. The integers can be up to 100 digits in decimal notation.\nTask 3: You are given a string which consists of uppercase letters (A-Z), and ends with the \"?\" sign. You are to output this string in reverse order without the \u201c?\u201d sign. For example, the string ABBCD? must be transformed into DCBBA\nTask 4: You are given a binary integer which consists of 0s and 1s. You are to write it as a string of letters \u201cz\u201d, and the total number of such letters must be equal to the given binary number. For example, 110 must be translated by the algorithm into \u201czzzzzz\u201d\nTask 5: You are given a string which consists of uppercase letters (A-Z), and ends with the \"?\" sign. You are to output this string in non-descending order without the \u201c?\u201d sign. After applying the rules to DFAAS?, the string should look like this: AADFS\nTask 6: You are given two decimal positive integers separated by the \"_\" symbol and followed by \"=?\", for example 30_42=?. You are to find and output the value of the greatest common divisor for this pair. For example for 30_42=? it\u2019ll be 6.\nNote: The limit on the increase of the string during the work of the algorithm is 100000 symbols.\n\nInput\nThere is no input data for this problem.\nOutput\nYou should output your solutions to every task one by one. If you don\u2019t want to solve some particular task just output 0, otherwise output the length of your solution N. Then output exactly N lines abc->def, where abc is the substring for replacement, and def is the substring by which it will be replaced.\nScore\nFor each correctly solved task you gain 1 point and additionally 1/N bonus points, where N is the length of the proposed solution.\n\nExample\n\nOutput:\n0\n0\n0\n5\na->b\nb->c\nd->v\ng->l\nl->a\n0\n0\n\nScore:\nIn this case (if the set of rules leads to a correct answer)you\u2019ll get 1 + 0.2 = 1.2 points for the 4-th task.\n\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndy: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2016-11-01 17:41:27\n\nThe number in task 6 is larger than 9999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitch Schwartz: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2013-11-14 15:26:28\n\nThe integers in task 6 aren't very small, as my solution using [snip] made the judge time out (internal error). It would be nice to know the maximum value of those integers. I don't see the point of making users guess.\n\nEdit: Censored my above comment because it might be able to pass with some modification, although I don't have time to test it right now. If it passes, I should be able to give a rough estimate of the constraints.\n\nEdit 2: Wasn't able to avoid internal error with my current approach so far; it handles integers up to about 1000 before becoming very slow, so I guess the test cases used are somewhat larger than that.\nLast edit: 2013-11-15 01:52:31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHagen von Eitzen: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2011-07-04 18:32:02\n\nHelp!\nA submission of mine (5335276) got \"internal error\".

We have some character set (alphabet), and a string composed of these symbols. Besides, we have rules of replacement, and each rule specifies the substring to be replaced and the replacement string. The replacement string can be empty. The order of rules is fixed. Everything functions as follows. Rules are looked through in input order. The first rule which can be applied, is applied exactly once (the given replacement which is described by the rule is carried out), and then the operation cycle repeats (the list is looked through anew). If there are many substrings in the line which satisfy a given rule then only the first (i.e., the leftmost) will be replaced. The process comes to an end if after the last rule application the line has not changed. During the process of replacements the length of the initial string can change, increasing or decreasing. \nExample:\nLet\u2019s consider the string ababaab\nand the set of rules\nab->c\ncc->ab\nAs a result of the application of rules the initial string will be transformed into \u201ccac\u201d. The following intermediate results will appear: ababaab, cabaab, ccaab, ccac, abac, cac.\n\nThat\u2019s all. And now some tasks.\nTask 1: The initial non-empty string was obtained from an ordinary arithmetic formula by the deletion of every symbol except brackets. You are to write the set of rules which transforms this string into the string \"RIGHT\" or \"WRONG\" depending on the correctness of brackets positions, following rules of bracket use in arithmetical expressions. For example, the string ()((())()) must be replaced by the string RIGHT, while the string (() must be replaced by the string WRONG with the same replacement rules.\nTask 2: The initial string represents an arbitrary string of the following type [integer1]+[integer2]=?, where [integer1] and [integer2] are decimal representation of some positive integers. You are to write a set of rules which translates the initial string into a string of the following type: [integer1]+[integer2]=[sum], where [sum] is the decimal representation of the sum of two numbers integer1 and integer2. For example, the string 2+2=? must be replaced by 2+2=4, and the string 25+76=? must be replaced by 25+76=101. The integers can be up to 100 digits in decimal notation.\nTask 3: You are given a string which consists of uppercase letters (A-Z), and ends with the \"?\" sign. You are to output this string in reverse order without the \u201c?\u201d sign. For example, the string ABBCD? must be transformed into DCBBA\nTask 4: You are given a binary integer which consists of 0s and 1s. You are to write it as a string of letters \u201cz\u201d, and the total number of such letters must be equal to the given binary number. For example, 110 must be translated by the algorithm into \u201czzzzzz\u201d\nTask 5: You are given a string which consists of uppercase letters (A-Z), and ends with the \"?\" sign. You are to output this string in non-descending order without the \u201c?\u201d sign. After applying the rules to DFAAS?, the string should look like this: AADFS\nTask 6: You are given two decimal positive integers separated by the \"_\" symbol and followed by \"=?\", for example 30_42=?. You are to find and output the value of the greatest common divisor for this pair. For example for 30_42=? it\u2019ll be 6.\nNote: The limit on the increase of the string during the work of the algorithm is 100000 symbols.\n"

I got 300 bytes for general solution but after that only tried to optimise code that relies on weak test data, so I'm not sure what the 300 would turn into trying to optimise for strong data. I think the problem setter would be pretty responsive if there is demand to make the test data stronger; I have his email address from communication on some other problems, if he doesn't respond to comments. Or, maybe the problem description could be changed instead.\n\nI didn't comment before because I figured such variations in input are in some sense \"small\", and could be guessed at, and didn't break the problem. It could even be considered part of the sport of golfing, to find exploitable weaknesses. There are some other similar situations in challenge section that I didn't comment on.\nLast edit: 2012-12-21 05:52:59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitch Schwartz: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2013-05-27 03:59:39\n\n@Jitesh: In what way did it fail?

Unfortunately, he soon learned that many of his programs that\nhe wrote for his old processor didn't work on the new processor.\nDeep inside the technical documentation for both processors, he found an explanation. In order to\nwork faster, the new processor imposes certain constraints on the machine code of programs,\nconstraints that never existed on the previous model.\nThe machine code of a processor consists of instructions that are executed sequentially. Each\ninstruction uses a byte of memory. Also, instructions can have zero or more parameters, each of which\nuses an additional byte of memory. In machine code, parameters immediately follow an instruction. \nWhen formatted as text, machine code instructions are uppercase letters, while parameters are\nlowercase letters. For example:\nA b c b B c c C D e f g h\nThis program consists of four instructions; the first takes three parameters, the second two, the third\nnone and the fourth takes four parameters. The program uses 13 bytes of memory.\nThe new processor model fetches memory in four-byte chunks so each instruction must start at a\nmemory address that is divisible by four (the first byte in memory is address 0). To achieve that, we\ncan insert NOP (no operation) instructions into the old program, instructions that do nothing and are\nnot limited to memory locations divisible by four. The above program, adapted to run on the new\nprocessor, can look like this:\nA b c b B c c NOP C NOP NOP NOP D e f g h\n\nThe instructions A, B, C and D are now at memory locations 0, 4, 8 and 12, which satisfies the\nprocessor's constraints.\nWrite a program that determines the smallest number of NOP instructions that need to be inserted\nfor the given program to work on the new processor model.\nInput\nThe input contains the machine code of the program written for the old processor model. The program\nwill consist of at most 200 English letters.\nThe program will always start in an instruction i.e. the first letter in the machine code will be uppercase.\nIf an instruction appears more than once in the machine code, it will always take the same number of\nparameters.\nOutput\nOutput the smallest number of NOP instructions needed to adapt the program for the new processor.\nExample\nInput\nAbcd\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\nInput\nEaEbFabG\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\nInput\nAbcbBccCDefgh\n\nOutput\n4\n\nScore is your source code length.

Are you sure the \"random characters\" aren't simply '\\r' (ASCII 13)? I agree formatting issues are annoying. For newer challenge problems it makes sense to ask for data to be cleaned up, for older problems I think it's best to leave them as they are, as it may change the nature of the problem in a non-trivial way -- the best solutions (in a given language, or overall) may be specially adapted to the formatting.

    "Description": "\nMirko purchased a new microprocessor. Unfortunately, he soon learned that many of his programs that\nhe wrote for his old processor didn't work on the new processor.\nDeep inside the technical documentation for both processors, he found an explanation. In order to\nwork faster, the new processor imposes certain constraints on the machine code of programs,\nconstraints that never existed on the previous model.\nThe machine code of a processor consists of instructions that are executed sequentially. Each\ninstruction uses a byte of memory. Also, instructions can have zero or more parameters, each of which\nuses an additional byte of memory. In machine code, parameters immediately follow an instruction. \nWhen formatted as text, machine code instructions are uppercase letters, while parameters are\nlowercase letters. For example:\nA b c b B c c C D e f g h\nThis program consists of four instructions; the first takes three parameters, the second two, the third\nnone and the fourth takes four parameters. The program uses 13 bytes of memory.\nThe new processor model fetches memory in four-byte chunks so each instruction must start at a\nmemory address that is divisible by four (the first byte in memory is address 0). To achieve that, we\ncan insert NOP (no operation) instructions into the old program, instructions that do nothing and are\nnot limited to memory locations divisible by four. The above program, adapted to run on the new\nprocessor, can look like this:\nA b c b B c c NOP C NOP NOP NOP D e f g h\n\nThe instructions A, B, C and D are now at memory locations 0, 4, 8 and 12, which satisfies the\nprocessor's constraints.\nWrite a program that determines the smallest number of NOP instructions that need to be inserted\nfor the given program to work on the new processor model."

    "Description": "\nSome days ago, Little Chucha bought a computer game. She is given a NxN board which she has to fill with the numbers 1 to N^2, no repetitions allowed. The computer calculates the sum of distances for each pair of consecutive numbers, that is, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, ..., N^2 -> 1. The goal is to make that sum as short as possible.\nAfter many hours spent playing, Chucha has mastered the game. So she bought a new version and now the goal is to make the sum of distances as big as possible. Can you help her?"

A brand new section is being planned, devoted to brilliant computer programmers just like you. Unfortunately, due to lack of space, the museum is going to have to build a brand new building and relocate into it.\nThe size and capacity of the new building differ from those of the original building. But the floor plans of both buildings are orthogonal polygons. An orthogonal polygon is a polygon whose internal angles are either 90o or 270o. If 90o angles are denoted as R (Right) and 270o angles are denoted as O (Obtuse) then a string containing only R and O can roughly describe an orthogonal polygon. For example, a rectangle (Figure 1) is the simplest orthogonal polygon and it can be described as RRRR (the angles are listed in counter-clockwise order, starting from any corner). Similarly, a cross-shaped orthogonal polygon (Figure 2) can be described by the sequence RRORRORRORRO, RORRORRORROR, or ORRORRORRORR. These sequences are called angle strings.\n\nOf course, an angle string does not completely specify the shape of a polygon -- it says nothing about the length of the sides. And some angle strings cannot possibly describe a valid orthogonal polygon (RRROR, for example).\nTo complicate things further, not all orthogonal polygons are acceptable floor plans for the museum. A museum contains many valuable objects, and these objects must be guarded. Due to cost considerations, no floor can have more than one guard. So a floor plan is acceptable only if there is a place within the floor from which one guard can see the entire floor. Similarly, an angle string is acceptable only if it describes at least one acceptable polygon. Note that the cross-shaped polygon in Figure 2 can be guarded by someone standing in the center, so it is acceptable. Thus the angle string RRORRORRORRO is acceptable, even though it also describes other polygons that cannot be properly guarded by a single guard.\nHelp the designers of the new building determine how many acceptable angle strings there are of a given length.\nInput\nThe input file contains exactly 42 test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing a positive integer L(1<= L <=500), which is the desired length of an angle string.

He taught  his players optimal tactics and improved their endurance and shape. So they qualified  for the soccer woldcup this year. Due to his perfectionism the coach attaches importance not only to the performance in the game but also before the game.  So he told the team captain in what formation the team should assemble before the national anthem is played.  Since each of the 11 team members has a unique number between 1 and 11  on his shirt, he can represent the formation as a permutation of  numbers.\nBefore the first game the coach told  the captain that the team    should  line up  in increasing order (picture (d)). But  some players forgot the ordering and the orientation of the formation like  in picture (a). Only player 1 has the right orientation.  The coach went nearly mad when he saw this desaster!  How could he solve the problem?\n\n\"Hmmm... I'll let my players dance!\". A great idea!               He took his notebook and started to create a choreography which leads to    his expected formation. Due to the fact that no one of the  players took dancing lessons he    restricts his dance to one basic move:  One player or more players who stand side by side can turn 180 degrees  around the center of the move. Picture (b) contains an example: The  players\n-11 -10 -9 -2\n(we mark players which stand in the wrong direction with  a minus) can do one move to\n2 9 10 11\nAs perfect as he is he calculated a dance with a minimum number of moves. It works perfectly and now he's planning to do dancing performances                      with teams with more than 11 members. So he needs your help to find optimal dancing moves...\nInput\nEach testcase starts with the number of team members n (0<=n< 2200).

Then the new submissions are rejudged.\nWhat about this idea ?\nPlease share your thoughts in the forum wishlist thread Overload of Pyramid.\nI think it's better to aggregate ideas about that in a single thread.\nLast edit: 2014-11-16 17:31:05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMin_25: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2014-11-16 09:28:13\n\nThe admin should clarify the algorithm of calculating the time limit.\n\nSome problems have an insane time limit after switched to the CUBE cluster.\nThis problem is one of them (current TL = 0.00 sec, previous TL = 20.00 sec).\n\nEDIT:\n@Francky\nThanks.

My impression was also that the problem is hard but doable, and that it could (maybe) be considered medium difficulty by some solvers who are better at this type of problem than I am. Besides difficulty, I think interest in a problem is somewhat biased toward problems that are new and problems that have recently been solved or attempted by other people -- maybe it's human nature.\nLast edit: 2014-05-19 23:26:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEncho: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2014-05-16 23:56:51\n\nVery good problem with interesting (though difficult) theory behind it. I'm surprised there aren't many accepted solutions as the papers describing the solution are published online.\nA note about the problem (gave me some WAs) : \"Only player 1 has the right orientation.\" is just for the example. In the problem you have to always make them all having + regardless of the orientation of player 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitch Schwartz: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2014-05-09 02:27:47\n\n@Vlad Duta: Judging doesn't halt on first failure. I would assume n=0 indicates the end of test data, like many other problems. I don't see anything ambiguous about 0 or 1 steps. Each case will be a signed permutation on [1..n]; it is stated implicitly but is pretty clear in my view. (The description for n=11 is explicit, and then we are told that n could be an integer different from 11.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVlad Duta: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2014-05-09 01:59:29\n\nIs there a bug in this problem's judge? It looks like I'm passing the first two tests no matter what I'm printing... Also the input/output specifications are pretty vague. Is the input zero-terminated? What should we print if the number of steps is 0 or 1? Can we assume that every input is a signed permutation of numbers between 1 and n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnmol Pandey: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2014-04-22 17:38:43\n\n@Siddhartha Sinha\nThis question have so accepted solution\nThese type of people don't deserve to be a spoj user...other times watch your comments...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMitch Schwartz: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2014-03-18 05:44:50\n\n@\u0993\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09b8\u09c0 (Wasi): I don't know if you did it on purpose, but \"tiring\" and \"tiresome\" mean different things (demanding vs. boring, approximately).

Also, the cost of creating a warp link increases directly with the linear distance between the link endpoints. \n\n\nThe Gorelians, being the dominant force in the known universe, are often bored, so they frequently conquer new regions of space in the following manner. \n\n\n\nThe initial invasion force finds a suitable planet and conquers it, establishing a Regional Gorelian Galactic Government, hereafter referred to as the RGGG, that will govern all Gorelian matters in this region of space. \n\nWhen the next planet is conquered, a single warp link is constructed between the new planet and the RGGG planet. Planets connected via warp links in this manner are said to be part of the Regional Gorelian Planetary Network, that is, the RGPN. \n\n\nAs additional planets are conquered, each new planet is connected with a single warp link to the nearest planet already in the RGPN, thus keeping the cost of connecting new planets to the network to a minimum. If two or more planets are equidistant from the new planet, the new planet is connected to whichever of them was conquered first. \n\n\n\nThis causes a problem however. Since planets are conquered in a more-or-less random fashion, after a while, the RGGG will probably not be in an ideal location. Some Gorelians needing to consult with the RGGG might only have to make one or two warps, but others might require dozens--very inconvenient when one considers the 10-hour waiting period between warps. \n\n\nSo, once each Gorelian year, the RGGG analyzes the RGPN and relocates itself to an optimal location. The optimal location is defined as a planet that minimizes the maximum number of warps required to reach the RGGG from any planet in the RGPN. As it turns out, there is always exactly one or two such planets. When there are two, they are always directly adjacent via a warp link, and the RGGG divides itself evenly between the two planets. \n\n\nYour job is to write a program that finds the optimal planets for the RGGG. For the purposes of this problem, the region of space conquered by the Gorelians is defined as a cube that ranges from (0,0,0) to (1000,1000,1000). \n\n\nInput\nThe input consists of a set of scenarios where the Gorelians conquer a region of space. Each scenario is independent. The first line of the scenario is an integer N that specifies the total number of planets conquered by the Gorelians. The next N lines of the input specify, in the order conquered, the IDs and coordinates of the conquered planets to be added to the RGPN, in the format \nID\u00a0X\u00a0Y\u00a0Z. An ID is an integer from 1 to 1000. X, Y, and Z are integers from 0 to 1000. A single space separates the numbers. A value of N = 0 marks the end of the input. \n\n\n\nOutput\nFor each input scenario, output the IDs of the optimal planet or planets where the RGGG should relocate.

Perhaps the most commonly\nused trees are rooted binary trees, but there are other types of rooted\ntrees that may be useful as well. One example is ordered trees, in\nwhich the subtrees for any given node are ordered. The number of\nchildren of each node is variable, and there is no limit on the number.\nFormally, an ordered tree consists of a finite set of nodes T such that\n\n\n there is one node designated as the root, denoted root(T);\n the remaining nodes are partitioned into subsets T1, T2, ..., Tm, each of which is also a tree (subtrees).\n\n\nAlso, define root(T1), ..., root(Tm) to be the children of root(T), with\nroot(Ti) being the i-th child. The nodes root(T1), ..., root(Tm) are\nsiblings.\nIt is often more convenient to represent an ordered\ntree as a rooted binary tree, so that each node can be stored in the\nsame amount of memory. The conversion is performed by the following\nsteps:\n\nremove all edges from each node to its children;\nfor each node, add an edge to its first child in T (if any) as the left child;\nfor each node, add an edge to its next sibling in T (if any) as the right child.\n\nThis is illustrated by the following:\n         0                             0\n       / | \\                          /\n      1  2  3       ===>             1\n        / \\                           \\\n       4   5                           2\n                                      / \\\n                                     4   3\n                                      \\\n                                       5\n\nIn most cases, the height of the tree (the number of edges in the longest\nroot-to-leaf path) increases after the conversion. This is undesirable\nbecause the complexity of many algorithms on trees depends on its\nheight.\nYou are asked to write a program that computes the height of the tree before and after the conversion.\nInput\nThe input is given by a number of lines giving the directions taken in a\ndepth-first traversal of the trees.

Kingdom 1 is the mightiest. The kingdoms are connected by bidirectional roads in which there is exactly once path between any two kingdoms.\nThe king hired you to make a strategic plan for him. His spies gave you two numbers for each country i (i>1):\n\nVi = the value of this country's oil sources\nCi = the cost of conquering this country\n\nA kingdom can be conquered only when it is adjacent to kingdom 1 or when you've conquered an adjacent kingdom to it (which is connected to it via a road).\nNow, your task is to make a plan to conquer other kingdoms so that the total value from oil sources is maximized. Never exceed the budget!"

A traditional Pachinko machine is a cross between a vertical pinball machine and a slot machine. The player launches small steel balls to the top of the machine using a plunger as in pinball. A ball drops through a maze of pins that deflect the ball, and eventually the ball either exits at a hole in the bottom and is lost, or lands in one of many gates scattered throughout the machine which reward the player with more balls in varying amounts. Players who collect enough balls can trade them in for prizes. \n\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, a linear Pachinko machine is a sequence of one or more of the following: holes ( .\"), floor tiles ( _\"), walls ( |\"), and mountains ( /\\\"). A wall or mountain will never be adjacent to another wall or mountain. To play the game, a ball is dropped at random over some character within a machine. A ball dropped into a hole falls through. A ball dropped onto a floor tile stops immediately. A ball dropped onto the left side of a mountain rolls to the left across any number of consecutive floor tiles until it falls into a hole, falls off the left end of the machine, or stops by hitting a wall or mountain. A ball dropped onto the right side of a mountain behaves similarly. A ball dropped onto a wall behaves as if it were dropped onto the left or right side of a mountain, with a 50% chance for each. If a ball is dropped at random over the machine, with all starting positions being equally likely, what is the probability that the ball will fall either through a hole or off an end? For example, consider the following machine, where the numbers just indicate character positions and are not part of the machine itself:\n\n\n\n\n\n123456789 \n/\\.|__/\\.\n\n\n\n\nThe probabilities that a ball will fall through a hole or off the end of the machine are as follows, by position: 1 = 100%, 2 = 100%, 3 = 100%, 4 = 50%, 5 = 0%, 6 = 0%, 7 = 0%, 8 = 100%, 9 = 100%.

He also discovered that these rooms were painted with different colors. Moreover, the doors on the walls of the chamber also had different colors. Harry had to guide each of his friends, one after another, to run to the door which had the same color with the room confined that person. But when a person escaped, immediately, the monsters would regained their lost energy (or the monsters would be strong as it'd just appeared) and the walls of the chamber rotated a unit clockwise. Also, the doors on them also went with them, as described on the figures below.\n\nBecause of the difficult situation, Harry could only guide the next friend after the current one had escaped the maze. Please help Harry to guide all his friends escaped the chamber in minimum time.\n(P.s: If you ask me \u2018How could Harry guide his friends?\u2019 Yeah, he used the \u2018Sonorus!\u2019 incantation. It made his voice resounded everywhere in the chamber. :D)"

The simulated track consists of n \n\nrails\nattached end-to-end with the beginning of the first rail fixed at elevation 0. Byteman, the operator, can reconfigure the\ntrack at will by adjusting the elevation change over a number of consecutive rails. The elevation change over other rails is\nnot affected. Each time rails are adjusted, the following track is raised or lowered as necessary to connect the track while\nmaintaining the start at elevation 0. The figure below illustrates two example track reconfigurations.\nEach ride is initiated by launching the car with sufficient energy to reach height h.

The\npaints are bright and fun to work with, and have the useful property\nthat if you mix X ml each of any three different colors, you\nget X ml of gray. (The paints are thick and \"airy\",\nalmost like cake frosting, and when you mix them together the volume\ndoesn't increase, the paint just gets more dense.)  None of the\nindividual colors are gray; the only way to get gray is by mixing\nexactly three distinct colors, but it doesn't matter which three. Your\nfriend Emily is an elementary school teacher and every Friday she does\na fingerpainting project with her class.  Given the number of\ndifferent colors needed, the amount of each color, and the amount of\ngray, your job is to calculate the number of kits needed for\nher class.\n\nInput\n The input consists of one or more test cases,\nfollowed by a line containing only zero that signals the end of the\ninput.  Each test case consists of a single line of five or more\nintegers, which are separated by a space.  The first integer N\nis the number of different colors (3 \u2264 N \u2264 12). Following\nthat are N different nonnegative integers, each at most 1,000,\nthat specify the amount of each color needed.  Last is a nonnegative\ninteger G \u2264 1,000 that specifies the amount of gray needed.\nAll quantities are in ml.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the smallest number of fingerpainting kits sufficient to provide the required amounts of all the colors and gray. Note that all grays are considered equal, so in order to find the minimum number of kits for a test case you may need to make grays using different combinations of three distinct colors.\n\nExample\nInput:\n3 40 95 21 0\n7 25 60 400 250 0 60 0 500\n4 90 95 75 95 10\n4 90 95 75 95 11\n5 0 0 0 0 0 333\n0\n\n\nOutput:\n2\n8\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by:Nikola P Borisov\nDate:2008-10-01\nTime limit:0.200s\n\t\t\t\nSource limit:50000B\nMemory limit:1536MB\n\nCluster:\n\nCube (Intel G860)\n\n\nLanguages:All except: ERL JS-RHINO NODEJS PERL6 VB.NET \nResource:ICPC North America Mid-Central Regional Contest 2005 \n",

Last is a nonnegative\ninteger G \u2264 1,000 that specifies the amount of gray needed.\nAll quantities are in ml.\n",
    "Description": "\nThe local toy store sells small fingerpainting kits with between\nthree and twelve 50ml bottles of paint, each a different color. The\npaints are bright and fun to work with, and have the useful property\nthat if you mix X ml each of any three different colors, you\nget X ml of gray. (The paints are thick and \"airy\",\nalmost like cake frosting, and when you mix them together the volume\ndoesn't increase, the paint just gets more dense.)  None of the\nindividual colors are gray; the only way to get gray is by mixing\nexactly three distinct colors, but it doesn't matter which three. Your\nfriend Emily is an elementary school teacher and every Friday she does\na fingerpainting project with her class.  Given the number of\ndifferent colors needed, the amount of each color, and the amount of\ngray, your job is to calculate the number of kits needed for\nher class.\n"

    "Description": "\nYou are playing a scavenger hunt game organized by your school.\nAssume the school is an infinite 2D field. The rules of the game are quite simple: There are n people from the organization, numbered from 1 to n. Person i is located at position (xi, yi). All you have to do is go to (xi, yi) and let the i-th person see you, for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. You can run from a position (xa, ya) to a position (xb, yb) in dist((xa,ya),(xb,yb)) seconds, where dist(P,Q) is the euclidian distance between points P and Q.\nInitially, you are at the same position of person 1, who already saw you. Also, initially you only know the position of person 1. To find out the position of some other person, you need to ask someone. Every person knows the position of all the others. However, if you ask person i where person j is, it will take him Wi,j seconds to answer. Your task is to find a sequence of questions and runnings that let you finish the game quickly. This is a partial problem - you do not need to find an optimal solution, but your score will be proportional to the solution you find.\nInput/Output\nThis is an iterative problem. Your program will \"talk\" to the judge directly via the standard input and output.\nThere are no more than 20 test cases. For each test case, the judge will start by printing\nSTART n\nx1 y1\nW1,1 W1,2 ...\u00a0 W1,n\nW2,1 W2,2 ...\u00a0 W2,n \n...\nWn,1 Wn,2 ...\u00a0 Wn,n\n(Assume 2\u2264n\u226440 and 0\u2264 xi,yi,Wi,j\u2264104).\nAfter reading that, your program should print commands. A command must be one of these:\n\nASK i ask the person that saw you last where the person i is. The judge will reply by printing ANSWER xi yi . You'll get \"Runtime Error\" if (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) doesn't hold.\nGO i go to the position of the person i and let him see you. The judge will reply by printing MOVED . You'll get \"Runtime Error\" if (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) doesn't hold or if you don't know the position of the person i yet.\nFINISH finish the game. The judge will reply by printing OK length , where length is the total time spent by you in the game of the test case in seconds, with exactly 3 fractional digits (this is just a \"bonus\"; your program should be able to calculate length by itself). You'll get \"Wrong Answer\" if you haven't been to everyone's position at least once.\nYou'll get \"Runtime error\" if your program prints something different from the commands described above.\n\nImediatally after printing OK length , the judge will start another test case by printing START ... . If there are no more test cases, the judge will print END instead. In this case, your program should terminate.\nPlease notice that you are allowed to ask more than one question or to not ask any questions at all to a person.\n Attention: the program should clear the output buffer after printing  each line. It can be done using fflush(stdout) command or by setting the proper  type of buffering at the beginning of the execution -  setlinebuf(stdout). \nAlso, while reading data from the judge in C/C++ using scanf, avoid hardcoding the commands you known you'll receive. For instance, prefer to use scanf(\"%s %d\",start_string,&n) instead of scanf(\"START %d\",&n).\nScore\nFor each test case, pi = min(1.0, length/greedy), where length is the total time spent by you, and greedy is the length obtained by a program that prints ASK 2 GO 2 ASK 3 GO 3 ... ASK n GO n FINISH.\nYour final score will be equal to ceil[ (\u2211(pi*ni)/\u2211ni)*100 ], where ni is the value of n in the i-th test case. The lower your score is, the better you're ranked.\nExemple\nThis is an exemple of the executation of a program that obtains greedy as the total spend time (and thus gets the score 100):\nJudge:\nSTART 3\n0 0\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\nProgram: ASK 2\nJudge: ANSWER 2 2\nProgram: GO 2\nJudge: MOVED\nProgram: ASK 3\nJudge: ANSWER 1 1\nProgram: GO 3\nJudge: MOVED\nProgram: FINISH\nJudge:\nOK 12.243\nEND\nProgram: <terminates>\n",

ASK n GO n FINISH.\nYour final score will be equal to ceil[ (\u2211(pi*ni)/\u2211ni)*100 ], where ni is the value of n in the i-th test case. The lower your score is, the better you're ranked.\nExemple\nThis is an exemple of the executation of a program that obtains greedy as the total spend time (and thus gets the score 100):\nJudge:\nSTART 3\n0 0\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\nProgram: ASK 2\nJudge: ANSWER 2 2\nProgram: GO 2\nJudge: MOVED\nProgram: ASK 3\nJudge: ANSWER 1 1\nProgram: GO 3\nJudge: MOVED\nProgram: FINISH\nJudge:\nOK 12.243\nEND\nProgram: <terminates>\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancky: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2014-11-15 23:58:42\n\nAccording to admins, the issue should be fixed with next language upgrade.

Though they keep the tradition. they now use an automatedgrilling machine to make crackers. Inside this machine, crackers are arranged in a grid with R rows andC columns (1 \u2264 R \u2264 10, 1 \u2264 C \u2264 10000).

Traders crossing the border have to pay customs duty of 50% of the value of the transported load. Byteotian merchants are threatened with bankruptcy.

At that both string, NyanCoder want to swap some element (or none) on string a\u00a0with element on string b\u00a0that located at same position. More specifically, NyanCoder may choose integer i, and then swap a[i] with b[i].\nNyanCoder want when he finished playing, both new string have non-decreasing element (e.g. \"aabbb\", \"cccdee\" but not \"bbaa\" or \"ebd\").

FJ would like to\nremove some of the pathways on his farm so that it becomes a tree -- that\nis, so that there is one unique route between any pair of fields.  Moreover,\nFarmer John would like this to be a minimum spanning tree -- a tree having\nthe smallest possible sum of edge lengths.\n\u00a0\nHelp Farmer John compute not only the sum of edge lengths in a minimum\nspanning tree derived from his farm graph, but also the number of different\npossible minimum spanning trees he can create.\n\u00a0\nPROBLEM NAME: simplify\n\u00a0\nINPUT FORMAT:\n\u00a0\n* Line 1: Two integers N and M (1 <= N <= 40,000; 1 <= M <= 100,000),\nrepresenting  the number of vertices and edges in the farm\ngraph, respectively.

The first two memory accesses cause faults, and locations 1 and 2 are loaded into the cache. The third access, to address 3, causes a fault as well, and location 3 is loaded into the cache; but, first, to make room for the value at address 3, and an optimal cache would evict location 2. The fourth access does not cause a fault because location 1 is still in the cache.\nIn total, there are 3 faults.\nSee also: FIFOCACH and LRUCACHE.\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by:Radu Grigore\nDate:2016-03-29\nTime limit:1s-5s\nSource limit:20000B\nMemory limit:1536MB\n\nCluster:\n\nCube (Intel G860)\n\n\nLanguages:All except: ASM64 GOSU JS-MONKEY \nResource:Belady, A study of replacement algorithms for virtual storage computers, 1966 \n",

For each integer value Z, there is a horizontal street at y=Z and a vertical street at x=Z. This way, integer coordinate pairs represent the street junctions. During the hot days, the gods rest in cafeterias at street junctions. Messenger Hermes is to send photon messages to gods resting in the cafeterias by only moving along the city streets. Each message is for a single god, and it does not matter if the other gods see the message.\nThe messages are to be sent in a given order, and Hermes is provided the coordinates of the cafeterias in that order. Hermes starts from (0,0). To send a message to a cafeteria at (Xi,Yi), Hermes only needs to visit some point on the same horizontal street (with y-coordinate Yi) or on the same vertical street (with x-coordinate Xi).

In order to prepare the miraculous drug he needs to buy a special enzyme, that is quite expensive and unfortunately loses its properties after a fixed period of time. Now Joe is in the clinical trial phase. He needs a drug available at each hour. Thus he has to prepare exactly the same quantity of drug every hour. The price of the enzyme might vary from hour to hour. The cost of the enzyme on hour i is c i . The life time of the enzyme is h hours. Given the prices for the next n hours, Joe has to find out the optimal cost to purchase enzymes such that the drug is available in each of the n hours. If the price is the same Joe prefers to buy fresh enzymes, not to stock them. We assume an unlimited quantity of enzymes is available each hour.

Consider all latice points (the points with integral coordinates) inside (including the edges) a rectangle formed by connecting points (0, 0), (n, 0), (n, m), and (0, m). There's a wad of sugar on each of those (m+1)(n+1) points. A lost ant begins his journey to get back home from point (0, 0). He is an ant, and ants love sugar very much, so he decides to take some of the wads home. Because of some unexplainable reason, if he was on (a, b), then he can only move to (a+1, b), (a+1, b+1), or (a, b-1). Of course the ant is not allowed to get out of the rectangle (or he will get lost, again). He knows that his house is at the other end of the rectangle i.e. (n, m). For example, let n = 3 and m = 2.

    "Description": "\nIn a little town called Kri\u017e live N people. Each of them has borrowed some money from exactly one\nother inhabitant. Now the time has come to pay back all the debts, but the problem is that everybody \nhas spent all of their money!  \nThe major of Kri\u017e has decided to solve this problem. The town will give money to a few people so that \nthey can pay back their debts. When some people get their money back, a chain reaction is started . for \nexample: person A gets money from the city. Person A uses that money to pay the debt toward person \nB. Person B then uses that money to pay the debt towards person C etc. If person B didn\u2019t have \nenough money to pay back the debt, they wait until  they get enough. If they have more than enough \nmoney, person B will keep what is left after payback.  \nAnother example: if two people live in Kri\u017e, and they owe $100 to each other, the town will give $100 \nto one of them so they can pay back the debt to the other one.  \nYour task is to calculate the minimum total amount of money the town has to give to some subset \nof the inhabitants so that after the payback protocol described above all debts are payed. \nINPUT \nFirst line of input contains one integer N (2 \u2264 N \u2264 200 000), number of inhabitants of Kri\u017e.

(x1, y1) and (x2, y2) represent the coordinates of the bottom left corner and the top right corner, respectively, of the ith masking tape on the plywood.\nNote that the coordinates of the bottom left corner of the plywood is (0, 0) and the coordinates of the top right corner of it is (w, h).\nOutput\n- The output \ufb01le should contain a single integer, which is the minimum number of colors to be able to paint the input plywood with.\n\nSample\nInput:\n15 6\n10\n1 4 5 6\n2 1 4 5\n1 0 5 1\n6 1 7 5\n7 5 9 6\n7 0 9 2\n9 1 10 5\n11 0 14 1\n12 1 13 5\n11 5 14 6\n\nOutput:\n5\n\n\nLimitations\n- 1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000.\n- 1 \u2264 w, h \u2264 106.\n30% of the mark is given for test cases with w \u2264 100, h \u2264 100, n \u2264 100.\n\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by:AnhDQ\nDate:2009-05-10\nTime limit:0.300s\n\t\t\t\nSource limit:50000B\nMemory limit:1536MB\n\nCluster:\n\nCube (Intel G860)\n\n\nLanguages:All except: ERL JS-RHINO NODEJS PERL6 VB.NET \nResource:JOI08 \n"

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL2R - Learn to Read\n\n\n#adhoc\n\n\n\n\nMost problems on SPOJ are very reliant on the problem description. An unclear problem description can make the problem harder to solve than it should be. That's why the goal of this problem's description is to ensure that you have all the necessary information you need. However, it's not easy to include all information in the description without telling too much about the solution of the problem. Especially in riddles, where most problem descriptions are unclear. Some of them even have no problem description!\nThis problem is probably the easiest problem in SPOJ because I will give you the answer to this problem in the description. Well it's technically not the actual answer, but rather how you handle the test data correctly. If you already know what you're supposed to do with the input, I can ensure that you will solve this problem easily. It will be very simple, so simple that you can probably solve this if you have coded \"Hello World!\" at some point in your life. But then again, you might have forgotten how to code. But it's none of my concern.\nSome people don't like long problem statement, and often times just read the input and output straight away. Maybe you just did that and come back here because you don't understand the input and output? That's why I told you that problem description is very important, don't skip it! Without it you will most likely lost on what you have to do. That is the power of a great problem description.\nYou're probably already itching to know what you have to do to get accepted in this problem. So now I will tell you how you solve this problem. Ready? Okay, here we go. You must process the input which consists of a number that will fit in a signed sixteen bit integer. Why sixteen bit you ask? Because I think it's unnecessary to increase the constraint to thirty-two or sixty-four bit since it won't add much difficulty to the problem. Decreasing it to two or three bit is also possible, but I like sixteen bit. But how do you process it? I might or might not have told you, but it's on the problem description.\nIf you still did not know what you are supposed to do with the input, perhaps you should start over reading from the top. Make sure you don't miss a single word that I typed here. You could also choose to continue reading, but I doubt it will benefit you anything. If you already read over but still can't understand what you have to do, maybe the next paragraph will help. I can't guarantee that, though.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\nNote that this last paragraph doesn't tell you anything, it's just here to make the problem statement longer and to punish those people that only read the last paragraph. You must respect the effort made by the problem setter to create a story fitting for the problem, it's not easy you know. Also, the paragraph before this is useless. You should totally ignore it.\nInput\nAn integer\nOutput\nAn integer\nExample\nInput:\n0\n\nOutput:\n0\n\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naditya_rev: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2017-02-04 11:33:54\n\nI just searching wat is lorem ipsum bla bla bla on google.

    "Description": "\nMost problems on SPOJ are very reliant on the problem description. An unclear problem description can make the problem harder to solve than it should be. That's why the goal of this problem's description is to ensure that you have all the necessary information you need. However, it's not easy to include all information in the description without telling too much about the solution of the problem. Especially in riddles, where most problem descriptions are unclear. Some of them even have no problem description!\nThis problem is probably the easiest problem in SPOJ because I will give you the answer to this problem in the description. Well it's technically not the actual answer, but rather how you handle the test data correctly. If you already know what you're supposed to do with the input, I can ensure that you will solve this problem easily. It will be very simple, so simple that you can probably solve this if you have coded \"Hello World!\" at some point in your life. But then again, you might have forgotten how to code. But it's none of my concern.\nSome people don't like long problem statement, and often times just read the input and output straight away. Maybe you just did that and come back here because you don't understand the input and output? That's why I told you that problem description is very important, don't skip it! Without it you will most likely lost on what you have to do. That is the power of a great problem description.\nYou're probably already itching to know what you have to do to get accepted in this problem. So now I will tell you how you solve this problem. Ready? Okay, here we go. You must process the input which consists of a number that will fit in a signed sixteen bit integer. Why sixteen bit you ask? Because I think it's unnecessary to increase the constraint to thirty-two or sixty-four bit since it won't add much difficulty to the problem. Decreasing it to two or three bit is also possible, but I like sixteen bit. But how do you process it? I might or might not have told you, but it's on the problem description.\nIf you still did not know what you are supposed to do with the input, perhaps you should start over reading from the top. Make sure you don't miss a single word that I typed here. You could also choose to continue reading, but I doubt it will benefit you anything. If you already read over but still can't understand what you have to do, maybe the next paragraph will help. I can't guarantee that, though.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\nNote that this last paragraph doesn't tell you anything, it's just here to make the problem statement longer and to punish those people that only read the last paragraph. You must respect the effort made by the problem setter to create a story fitting for the problem, it's not easy you know. Also, the paragraph before this is useless. You should totally ignore it."

Actually for these types of problems there are an infinite number of valid sequences with a \"simple\" formula when given the first n terms, for n arbitrary large. Just look up interpolating polynomial. And that's why it is in riddle section. There are a handful of somewhat similar problems that I consider \"grandfathered in\" and have been allowed to stay in classical or challenge (with some discussion): SUMUP, EASYPROB, EPROBLEM, HARDP, and maybe more that I don't know about or can't think of at the moment.\n\nAlso, the 5th term is already given in both the problem statement and the example input/output.\nLast edit: 2014-01-03 21:08:36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPranjal Successena: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2014-01-03 15:29:15\n\nthis is an incomplete problem...\nthis series can extend to 2 types..\n\nu shud hav given 5th term also.\npls be clear on your que\nLast edit: 2014-01-03 18:31:40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnarek: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2013-11-10 15:27:23\n\nCan I have a big test case\nlike the answer for 50000???\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by:Mukund Kumar\nDate:2013-08-30\nTime limit:0.100s\n\t\t\t\nSource limit:300B\nMemory limit:1536MB\n\nCluster:\n\nCube (Intel G860)\n\n\nLanguages:C CSHARP CPP C++ 4.3.2 C99 JAVA PYTHON PYTHON3 PY_NBC \nResource:Self \n",

So it seems altogether likely that the problem can be solved in 0 bytes in Bash, although I don't know the trickery involved. Having 0 as the top score could break the scoring system. And even if this issue is dealt with (e.g. by adding a 1 to the score), the problem is in some sense a duplicate of SIZECON. @problem setter: What is your intent? Are you aware of these issues?\n\nAnd my Whitespace solution is way too slow, I have some doubt whether it can be sped up enough for the constraints. It's 781 bytes (I didn't try to reduce), and can print from 0 to 25 in under 1s, so e.g. 1000 byte source limit and reduced input constraints would prevent precomputation and allow it to pass.\n\nI don't know, it seems very strangely designed to me.\nLast edit: 2012-12-13 23:49:57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAditya Pande: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2012-12-13 16:28:30\n\n@problem setter\nthere are more lines in the input file than T specified following the T line\ncan you please fix that.

Unfortunately, even the best programmers sometimes aren't able to spot these tiny but necessary changes until it's too late... and that's why we developed a brand-new BottomCoder training for them!\n\nThe idea is very simple \u2013 you're given a problem specification, a source code, and a list of permitted modifications.

The contest starts with a coding phase where the contestants write code. After the coding phase there is a challenge phase. In this phase one can gain points when she finds a bug in someone else's code. \nWe were all lame and performed very badly. In fact, none of our programs worked. Thus we decided to hold a new contest: the Jam Code.

However, the almost equilateral triangle 5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units. We shall define an almost equilateral triangle to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit. Find the sum of the perimeters of every almost equilateral triangles with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion (1,000,000,000).\n\nProblem 2 If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)*(14/20) = 1/2. The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs. By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.\n\nProblem 3 Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n < d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction. If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d <= 8 in ascending order of size, we get:\n1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8\nIt can be seen that there are 3 fraction between 1/3 and 1/2.

In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube. Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.\n\nProblem 6 Euler's Totient function, phi(n), is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, phi(9) = 6. Interestingly, phi(87109) = 79180,and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.

Bouncy number become more and more common and by the time we reach 21780 the proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.\nFind the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is exactly 99%.\n\nProblem 5 The radical of n, rad(n) - is the product of distinct prime factors of n. \nFor example, 1008 = 2^4*3^2*7 , so rad(1008) = 2*3*7 = 42.\nIf we calculate rad(n) for 1 <= n <= 10, then sort them with respect to rad(n), breaking ties by sorting with respect to the value of n, we get:\n\nUnsorted:\nn = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nrad(n) = 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 10\n\nSorted:\nn = 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 9, 5, 6, 7, 10\nrad(n) = 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10\nk = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10  \n\nLet E(k) be the kth element in the sorted n column; for example, E(4) = 8 and E(6) = 9.\n\nIf rad(n) is sorted for 1 <= n <= 100000, find E(10000).\n\nProblem 6 \nConsider the infinite polynomial series: AF(x) = x*F(1) + x^2*F(2) + x^3*F(3) + ..., \nwhere F(k) is the kth term in the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...,\nthat is, F(1) = 1; F(2) = 1; F(k) = F(k-1) + F(k-2).\n\nFor this problem we shall be interested in values of x for which AF(x) is a positive integer.\n\nSurprisingly AF(1/2) = 1/2 + 1/4 + 2/8 + 3/16 + 5/32 + ... = 2\n\nThe corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are shown below:\n\n1) x = sqrt(2)-1 AF(x) = 1\n2) x = 1/2 AF(x) = 2\n3) x = (sqrt(13)-2)/3 AF(x) = 3\n4) x = (sqrt(89)-5)/8 AF(x) = 4\n5) x = (sqrt(34)-3)/5 AF(x) = 5\n\nWe shall call AF(x) a golden nugget if x is rational, because they become increasingly rarer; for example, the 10th golden nugget is 74049690.\n\nFind the 15th golden nugget.\n\nProblem 7\nEuler's totient function F(n) is defined as the number of positive integers not exceeding n that are relatively prime to n, where 1 is counted as being relatively prime to all numbers.  So, for example, F(20) = 8, \n\nbecause the eight integers 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, and 19 are relatively prime to 20.

If the sum is not a palindrome (which means, it is not the same number from left to right and right to left), repeat this procedure.\nEl m\u00e9todo \"invertir y sumar\" es simple: elija un n\u00famero, invierta sus d\u00edgitos y s\u00famelo al original. Si la suma no es un pal\u00edndromo (es decir que no es el mismo n\u00famero de izquierda a derecha que de derecha a izquierda), repita el procedimiento.\nFor example: - Por ejemplo:195 Initial number - N\u00famero inicial591 ----- 786 687 ----- 1473 3741 ----- 5214 4125 ----- 9339 Resulting palindrome - Pal\u00edndromo resultante\nIn this particular case the palindrome 9339 appeared after the 4th addition. This method leads to palindromes in a few step for almost all of the integers. But there are interesting exceptions. 196 is the first number for which no palindrome has been found. It is not proven though, that there is no such a palindrome.\nEn este caso particular el pal\u00edndromo 9339 apareci\u00f3 luego de la 4ta. suma.

    "Description": "\n\n  The rapidly growing popularity of Bytean chess is the reason why many different\n  variants of this game have been invented.\n  Because the traditional version is played on an infinite chessboard, what\n  can be quite troublesome, sometimes simpler variants are chosen,\n  in which the dimensions of the chessboards are bounded by 100000 * 100000.\n  \n  Some squares of the chessboard are black and the remaining ones are white,\n  however the painting pattern depends on the particular chessboard.\n  A pawn moves on such a chessboard in a bit different way than in traditional\n  chess - it can move horizontally, vertically or diagonally to any of the\n  adjacent eight squares provided that this square has the\n  same colour as the square currently occupied by the pawn.\n\n\nExamples of valid moves.\n\n  For given pairs of squares on the chessboard it should be determined whether\n  a pawn can travel between these squares.\n"

Teachers encourage pupils to play the game as it enhances their arithmetic skills, logical thinking, and following-up simple procedures. We think that, most probably, you too will master in few minutes. Here\u2019s one example of how you too can play this game: Ask a friend to think of a number, let\u2019s call it n0 . Then:\n\nAsk your friend to compute n1 = 3 \u2217 n0 and to tell you if n1 is even or odd.\nIf n1 is even, ask your friend to compute n2 = n1 /2. If, otherwise, n1 was odd then let your friend compute n2 = (n1 + 1)/2.\nNow ask your friend to calculate n3 = 3 \u2217 n2 .\nAsk your friend to tell tell you the result of n4 = n3 /9. (n4 is the quotient of the division operation. In computer lingo, \u2019/\u2019 is the integer-division operator.)\nNow you can simply reveal the original number by calculating n0 = 2 \u2217 n4 if n1 was even, or n0 = 2 \u2217 n4 + 1 otherwise.\n\nHere\u2019s an example that you can follow: If n0 = 37, then n1 = 111 which is odd. Now we can calculate n2 = 56, n3 = 168, and n4 = 18, which is what your friend will tell you. Doing the calculation 2 \u00d7 n4 + 1 = 37 reveals n0 .\nInput\nYour program will be tested on one or more test cases. Each test case is made of a single positive number (0 < n0 < 1, 000, 000).\nThe last line of the input file has a single zero (which is not part of the test cases.)\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the following line:\nk.

    "Description": "\nNumber guessing is a popular game between elementary-school kids. Teachers encourage pupils to play the game as it enhances their arithmetic skills, logical thinking, and following-up simple procedures. We think that, most probably, you too will master in few minutes. Here\u2019s one example of how you too can play this game: Ask a friend to think of a number, let\u2019s call it n0 . Then:\n\nAsk your friend to compute n1 = 3 \u2217 n0 and to tell you if n1 is even or odd.\nIf n1 is even, ask your friend to compute n2 = n1 /2. If, otherwise, n1 was odd then let your friend compute n2 = (n1 + 1)/2.\nNow ask your friend to calculate n3 = 3 \u2217 n2 .\nAsk your friend to tell tell you the result of n4 = n3 /9. (n4 is the quotient of the division operation. In computer lingo, \u2019/\u2019 is the integer-division operator.)\nNow you can simply reveal the original number by calculating n0 = 2 \u2217 n4 if n1 was even, or n0 = 2 \u2217 n4 + 1 otherwise.\n\nHere\u2019s an example that you can follow: If n0 = 37, then n1 = 111 which is odd. Now we can calculate n2 = 56, n3 = 168, and n4 = 18, which is what your friend will tell you. Doing the calculation 2 \u00d7 n4 + 1 = 37 reveals n0 ."

Por ejemplo, si el mensaje es \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home on a snowy night\u201d y hay 5 columnas, Mo escribe:\u00a0\nt o i o yh p k n ne l e a ir a h s ge c o n hs e m o tn l e w x\nNote that Mo includes only letters and writes them all in lower case. In this example, Mo used the character \u2018x\u2019 to pad the message out to make a rectangle, although he could have used any letter. Mo then sends the message to Larry by writing the letters in each row, alternating left-to-right and right-to-left. So, the above would be encrypted as\nObservar que Mo incluye s\u00f3lo letras y las escribe a todas en min\u00fasculas. En este ejemplo, Mo us\u00f3 la letra 'x' para rellenar el mensaje hasta completar un rect\u00e1ngulo, aunque el podr\u00eda haber usado cualquier letra. Mo luego env\u00eda el mensaje a Larry escribiendo las letras en cada fila, alternativamente de izquierda a derecha y de derecha a izquierda. As\u00ed, el rect\u00e1ngulo anterior se encripta como:\ntoioynnkpheleaigshareconhtomesnlewx\nYour job is to recover for Larry the original message (along with any extra padding letters) from the encrypted one.\nTu trabajo es recuperar para Larry el mensaje original (junto con todas las letras de relleno) a partir del mensaje encriptado.\nInput\nThere will be multiple input sets. Input for each set will consist of two lines. The first line will contain an integer in the range 2...20 indicating the number of columns used. The next line is a string of up to 200 lower case letters. The last input set is followed by a line containing a single 0, indicating end of input.\nEntrada\nHay varios casos de entrada. Cada caso consiste de dos l\u00edneas. La primer l\u00ednea contiene un entero en el rango 2..20 que indica el n\u00famero de columnas usadas. La l\u00ednea siguiente es un string de hasta 200 letras min\u00fasculas. El \u00faltimo caso de entrada viene seguido por una l\u00ednea que contiene \u00fanicamente un 0, indicando fin de la entrada.\nOutput\nEach input set should generate one line of output, giving the original plaintext message, with no spaces.\nSalida\nCada caso de entrada tiene que generar una l\u00ednea de salida, con el texto original del mensaje, sin espacios.\nExample - Ejemplo\nInput: Entrada:5toioynnkpheleaigshareconhtomesnlewx3ttyohhieneesiaabss0\nOutput: Salida:\ntheresnoplacelikehomeonasnowynightxthisistheeasyoneab\n\n\n\n Submit solution!\n\n\n\n\n\nhide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nraw_input(): \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2013-06-15 14:17:40\n\nTO AND FRO got AC with the same sol but got WA for this prob......i dnt know why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnight: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2013-06-15 14:17:40\n\nproblem is accepted for to and fro but getting WA for this ....\nwat is the format of the output is there a new line any where ??\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2013-06-15 14:17:40\n\nThere is no difference between this problem and TOANDFRO.\nLast edit: 2009-10-25 20:54:25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by:Coach UTN FRSF\nDate:2009-09-02\nTime limit:0.118s-0.260s\nSource limit:50000B\nMemory limit:1536MB\n\nCluster:\n\nCube (Intel G860)\n\n\nLanguages:All \nResource:Original version TO and Fro here in spoj \n"

Perhaps realizing you could do this was part of the trick?\n\nAjay, I agree that this is a very easy problem, but I don't think that's grounds for making it tutorial. Take for example JULKA. That's even easier than this problem, just use a language with big integer support. And what about problem ACT? If you see the trick, it's trivial. I think that the scoring method, which is based on the number of users who solved a problem, accounts for relative difficulty of problems, and I personally believe it's good to have easy problems in the classical set to encourage new programmers.\n\nBut anyway, since most people don't care one way or the other, and a few people would rather see this as a tutorial problem, here goes :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhendrik: \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2009-10-26 13:29:41\n\nIf they are simple you should at least limit the code size. \nFor the given input there are 63*2 triples.\nYou dont even have to calculate anything.

Note that the pronoun tu (you) is implicit; unlike English, the person can be derived from the verb alone.\nIn order to avoid compatibility problems between computers of different character encodings, we substituted some letters. Throughout this problem, we will write A instead of \u00e1, E instead of \u00e9 and I instead of \u00ed.

Each succesive number is generated by looking at the previous number and saying the size of each group of repeated digits.\nFrom Wikipedia:\nTo generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. For example:\n\n1 is read off as \"one 1\" or 11.\n11 is read off as \"two 1s\" or 21.\n21 is read off as \"one 2, then one 1\" or 1211.\n1211 is read off as \"one 1, then one 2, then two 1s\" or 111221.\n111221 is read off as \"three 1s, then two 2s, then one 1\" or 312211.\n\n\n\nDescription\nLuke and Sally really like the look-and-say sequence. Luke likes to look at the numbers, and Sally likes to say them. Because the numbers in this sequence grow very long very quickly, Sally has proposed an alternate sequence that keeps the numbers shorter. Her idea is that instead of looking at groups of repeated digits, you look at the total number of each digit in the entire number, and say those. For example:\n\n1 is read off as \"one 1\" or 11.\n11 is read off as \"two 1s\" or 21.\n21 is read off as \"one 1, and one 2\" or 1112.\n1112 is read off as \"three 1s, and one 2\" or 3112.\n3112 is read off as \"two 1s, one 2, and one 3\" or 211213.\n\nBecause Luke still prefers the classic look-and-say sequence, they decide to compromise. If the number is EVEN, then they will use the classic method to generate the next number, and if the number is ODD, they will use Sally's new method.\nBecause this compromise complicates things, they have asked you to write a program to help them keep everything straight.

Each succesive number is generated by looking at the previous number and saying the size of each group of repeated digits.\nFrom Wikipedia:\nTo generate a member of the sequence from the previous member, read off the digits of the previous member, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit. For example:\n\n1 is read off as \"one 1\" or 11.\n11 is read off as \"two 1s\" or 21.\n21 is read off as \"one 2, then one 1\" or 1211.\n1211 is read off as \"one 1, then one 2, then two 1s\" or 111221.\n111221 is read off as \"three 1s, then two 2s, then one 1\" or 312211.\n\n\n\nDescription\nLuke and Sally really like the look-and-say sequence. Luke likes to look at the numbers, and Sally likes to say them. Because the numbers in this sequence grow very long very quickly, Sally has proposed an alternate sequence that keeps the numbers shorter. Her idea is that instead of looking at groups of repeated digits, you look at the total number of each digit in the entire number, and say those. For example:\n\n1 is read off as \"one 1\" or 11.\n11 is read off as \"two 1s\" or 21.\n21 is read off as \"one 1, and one 2\" or 1112.\n1112 is read off as \"three 1s, and one 2\" or 3112.\n3112 is read off as \"two 1s, one 2, and one 3\" or 211213.\n\nBecause Luke still prefers the classic look-and-say sequence, they decide to compromise. If the number is EVEN, then they will use the classic method to generate the next number, and if the number is ODD, they will use Sally's new method.\nBecause this compromise complicates things, they have asked you to write a program to help them keep everything straight. Given an initial number N, your program should generate the next number in the sequence according to the Luke-and-Sally compromise.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T, representing the number of test cases.

    "Problem": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOTHE - DO THE UNTWIST\n\n\nno tags\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nCryptography deals with methods of secret communication that transform a message (the plaintext) into a disguised form (the ciphertext) so that no one seeing the ciphertext will be able to figure out the plaintext, except the intended recipient. Transforming the plaintext to the ciphertext is encryption; transforming the ciphertext to the plaintext is decryption. Twisting is a simple encryption method that requires that the sender and recipient both agree on a secret key k, which is a positive integer.\n The twisting method uses four arrays: plaintext and ciphertext are arrays of characters, and plaincode and ciphercode are arrays of integers. All arrays are of length n, where n is the length of the message to be encrypted. Arrays are origin zero, so the elements are numbered from 0 to n - 1. For this problem all messages will contain only lowercase letters, the period, and the underscore (representing a space).\n The message to be encrypted is stored in plaintext. Given a key k, the encryption method works as follows. First convert the letters in plaintext to integer codes in plaincode according to the following rule: 'SPMamp_&' = 0, 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26, and '.' = 27. Next, convert each code in plaincode to an encrypted code in ciphercode according to the following formula: for all i from 0 to n - 1,\nciphercode[i] = (plaincode[ki mod n] - i)mod 28.\n(Here x mod y is the positive remainder when x is divided by y. For example, 3 7 = 3, 22 8 = 6, and -1 28 = 27. You can use the C '%' operator to compute this as long as you add y if the result is negative.)\nFinally, convert the codes in ciphercode back to letters in ciphertext according to the rule listed above. The final twisted message is in ciphertext. Twisting the message \"cat\" using the key 5 yields the following:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nArray\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nplaintext\n\n\n'c'\n\n\n'a'\n\n\n't'\n\n\n\n\nplaincode\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\nciphercode\n\n\n3\n\n\n19\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\nciphertext\n\n\n'c'\n\n\n's'\n\n\n'.'\n\n\n\n\nYour task is to write a program that can untwist messages, i.e., convert the ciphertext back to the original plaintext given the key k. For example, given the key 5 and ciphertext 'cs', your program must output the plaintext 'cat'.\u00a0\nInput\nThe input file DotheUntwist.in contains one or more test cases, followed by a line containing only the number 0 that signals the end of the file. Each test case is on a line by itself and consists of the key k, a space, and then a twisted message containing at least one and at most 70 characters. The key k will be a positive integer not greater than 300\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the untwisted message on a line by itself.\nNote: you can assume that untwisting a message always yields a unique result.

Gained some things but also lost many more.\nOne of the many things, we gained is 50K+ people who at least know about computer programming. They will inform many others also. Many of us here have very bad luck to hear about programming in their CS course. Before that I also did not know that we can do many more things with computer except hearing music, watching movie and playing video games. Hope One day we will have 500K+. So Happy Coding.\n\u00a0\nThe Problem\nThe Problem statement is Completely imagined. It have no relation to reality. If it matches any event It is just a coincidence.\n\u00a0\nIn Our Programming Problem in Bangla group the members have been increased so fast. Seeing that the everyone was happy. Our Admin Hasan Vai had a tour in\u00a0 \u201cNoakhali\u201d \u2013 one of the most important district in Bangladesh. On the way to noakhali he discovered something strange. He discovered that the members of the group are growing following a series.\u00a0 After a lot more brainstorming he found the series like that \u2013\n\u00a0\n(Xi)\u00a0is\u00a0 Xi\u00a0=\u00a0Yi\u00a0(for\u00a0i\u00a0<=\u00a0k)\u00a0 Xi\u00a0= C1\u00a0* Xi-1\u00a0+ C2\u00a0* Xi-2\u00a0+.......+ Ck*Xi-k\u00a0(for\u00a0i\u00a0>\u00a0k)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere Xi \u00a0is the total members in ith time. Now he wants to find the members between time l to r. The results can be very large so he is calculating values modulo 109+7 (1000000007). As he is going to be very busy with teaching (really don\u2019t know, infect he can be very busy with cutting cakes), he wants you to help him.\u00a0 He will give you l and r, Q times and he wants you to find maximum 100 terms from\u00a0Xl\u00a0to\u00a0Xr\u00a0in non decreasing order.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInput\u00a0: First line contains\u00a0T, the number of test cases.

Gained some things but also lost many more.\nOne of the many things, we gained is 50K+ people who at least know about computer programming. They will inform many others also. Many of us here have very bad luck to hear about programming in their CS course. Before that I also did not know that we can do many more things with computer except hearing music, watching movie and playing video games. Hope One day we will have 500K+. So Happy Coding.\n\u00a0\nThe Problem\nThe Problem statement is Completely imagined. It have no relation to reality. If it matches any event It is just a coincidence.\n\u00a0\nIn Our Programming Problem in Bangla group the members have been increased so fast. Seeing that the everyone was happy. Our Admin Hasan Vai had a tour in\u00a0 \u201cNoakhali\u201d \u2013 one of the most important district in Bangladesh. On the way to noakhali he discovered something strange. He discovered that the members of the group are growing following a series.\u00a0 After a lot more brainstorming he found the series like that \u2013\n\u00a0\n(Xi)\u00a0is\u00a0 Xi\u00a0=\u00a0Yi\u00a0(for\u00a0i\u00a0<=\u00a0k)\u00a0 Xi\u00a0= C1\u00a0* Xi-1\u00a0+ C2\u00a0* Xi-2\u00a0+.......+ Ck*Xi-k\u00a0(for\u00a0i\u00a0>\u00a0k)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere Xi \u00a0is the total members in ith time. Now he wants to find the members between time l to r. The results can be very large so he is calculating values modulo 109+7 (1000000007). As he is going to be very busy with teaching (really don\u2019t know, infect he can be very busy with cutting cakes), he wants you to help him.\u00a0 He will give you l and r, Q times and he wants you to find maximum 100 terms from\u00a0Xl\u00a0to\u00a0Xr\u00a0in non decreasing order.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInput\u00a0: First line contains\u00a0T, the number of test cases.

If the paper gets folded and then unfolded, the gold leaf will stick to itself more readily than it will stick to the paper, so there will be patches of gold and patches of exposed paper. Note that the gold leaf will always stick to itself, rather than the paper. In the following example, the paper was folded along the dashed line. Notice how the gold leaf always sticks to one side or the other, never both.\nConsider a crude digital image of a sheet of gold leaf.

There are N teams attending the contest at that site, each sitting at a different location. Some are closer to room A, others are closer to room B, and others are equally distant.

Some are closer to room A, others are closer to room B, and others are equally distant. Given the number of balloons needed by each team and the distance from each team to room A, and to room B, what is the minimum total possible distance that must be traveled by all balloons as they are delivered to their respective teams, assuming they are allocated in an optimal fashion from rooms A and B? For the purposes of this problem, assume that all of the balloons are identical."

But, gasoline is so expensive nowadays! Maybe, by creatively changing lanes, you can minimize the distance you travel and save some money!\nYou will be given a description of several sections of a highway. All sections will have the same number of lanes. Think of your car as a point mass, moving down the center of the lane. Each lane will be 10 feet wide. There are two kinds of highway sections: curved and straight.\u00a0 You can only change lanes on straight sections, and it takes a minimum of 100 feet of the straight section to move over one lane. You can take longer than that, of course, if you choose.\nAll curve sections will make 90 degree turns.\u00a0 You cannot change lanes on a curve section. In addition, you must be driving along the exact middle of a lane during a turn.\u00a0 So during a turn your position will be 5 feet, or 15 feet, or 25 feet from the edge, etc.\u00a0\nGiven a description of a highway, compute the minimum total distance required travel the entire highway, including curves and lane changes.\u00a0 You can start, and end, in any lane you choose. Assume that your car is a point mass in the center of the lane. The highway may cross over/under itself, but the changes in elevation are miniscule, so you shouldn\u2019t worry about their impact on your distance traveled.\nInput\nThere will be several test cases in the input.

This indicates the type of the section: a straight section (S), a left curve (L) or a right curve (R). If the section is a straight section, then the number K (10 \u2264 K \u2264 10,000) is simply its length, in feet. If the section is a right or left curve, then the number K (10 \u2264 K \u2264 10,000) is the radius of the inside edge of the highway, again in feet. There will never be consecutive straight sections in the input, but multiple consecutive turns are possible.

The objective is to fill a 9\u00d79 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3\u00d73 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called \"boxes\", \"blocks\", \"regions\", or \"sub-squares\") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a unique solution.\nCompleted puzzles are always a type of Latin square with an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions. For example, the same single integer may not appear twice in the same row, column or in any of the nine 3\u00d73 subregions of the 9x9 playing board.\n\nFrench newspapers featured variations of the puzzles in the 19th century, and the puzzle has appeared since 1979 in puzzle books under the name Number Place.However, the modern Sudoku only started to become mainstream in 1986 by the Japanese puzzle company Nikoli, under the name Sudoku, meaning single number. It first appeared in a US newspaper and then The Times (UK) in 2004, from the efforts of Wayne Gould, who devised a computer program to rapidly produce distinct puzzles.\n\nSince the Sudoku game is pretty hard, Mr. Bruce Banner, who is also fond in sudoku games, creates a new modified version of normal sudoku. It is tiled by 8x8 grids and divided into 4 areas of 4x4 grids. \nThe rule is also simplified. You need to place numbers from 1 to 8 to the empty grids(denoted by a number 0) to the sudoku puzzle. Each number in the same columns or row must be distinct. In each area of 4x4 grids, it is allowed to have duplicate numbers up to 2 numbers. \nNow, your task is to help Mr. Bruce Banner to determine whether the modified sudoku puzzle he has created is of a valid puzzle or not. If it is a valid puzzle, you will also need to output the solution. \n\nNote: It is guaranteed that here is a unique answer in each test cases t\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T(1 \u2264 T \u2264 100), the number of testcases. Then, it will be followed by 8*T lines which contain the modified sudoku puzzles.  Each testcases will be separated by a newline. \n\nOutput\nFor each case print \"Test case #X: \", where X (1 \u2264 X \u2264 T) is the case number, followed by an answer \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a newline.

Luckily, there were some shelters that can protect the villagers from that spell, and there was still enough time for all of the villagers to go to any of the shelters available. Yet, the shelters were only able to hold some villagers. The wizard also created dark barriers in each islands so that every villagers could not escape from their islands.
