----------------------------------------------------

From the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, the Woburn Challenge was an annual computer programming competition hosted and run by Woburn C.I.'s Programming Enrichment Group. We feel that the time is right to relaunch this free and fun competition for aspiring computer science students in Canada. This year, we're prepared to give out thousands of dollars in prizes to top-performing primary and secondary school students in Canada. If you are a Canadian primary or secondary school student (grades 1-12), you must follow the registration instructions at [url=http://woburnchallenge.com/register]woburnchallenge.com/register[/url] to be officially eligible for prizes. While only this group of people can receive prizes, everyone is welcome to participate in the online rounds as observers.

This year, we're hosting 4 online rounds (each with a prize pool of over $500) and an in-person invitational finals at the end of the school year (even larger prizes to be announced!). The rounds will take place in October, December, February, April, and early June (for the finals).

[b]Online Round 1[/b]

[i]When:[/i] [b]Friday, October 16th, 2015 from 3:30 pm to 6:30 pm ET[/b]
[i]Where:[/i] The PEG Judge interface ([url=http://wcipeg.com/contests]wcipeg.com/contests[/url])
[i]Format:[/i] 2 divisions, 3 hours, 4 problems, infinite submissions, and live feedback.
[i]Prizes:[/i]
[list][*] Top 3 Junior division winners: [b]$50, $25, $25[/b]
[*] Top 5 Senior division winners: [b]$200, $100, $50, $50, $50[/b][/list]
Full format and rules can be found at: [url=http://woburnchallenge.com/contest]woburnchallenge.com/contest[/url]
