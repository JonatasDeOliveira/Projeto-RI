This contest proved to be one of our toughest yet, with the third problem of the senior division proven to be especially perplexing due to its ad-hoc nature. You may also have noticed that we decided to provide a kick to the junior division’s difficulty. The reason of course, is to keep all of you (even juniors!) on your toes and habitually challenged! 

The senior division prizewinners are:
[list][*][b]Jason Yuen[/b] of Pierre Elliott Trudeau High School ($200)
[*][b]Joey Yu[/b] of Thornhill Secondary School ($100)
[*][b]William Wen[/b] of Pierre Elliott Trudeau High School ($50)

As you could probably tell, we are cranking up the difficulty as the 2016-17 contest season progresses. While we expect you to be constantly practicing, we are also working to improve the contest experience from our end. In particular, we are aware that the judge was slow to provide live feedback due to the quantity of submissions being queued. In future rounds, improvements to the site and server will be made to help prevent this issue.

The senior division prizewinners are:
[list][*][b]Brian Chau[/b] of Woburn Collegiate Institute ($200)
[*][b]William Wen[/b] of Pierre Elliott Trudeau High School ($100)
[*][b]Jason Yuen[/b] of Pierre Elliott Trudeau High School ($50)
[*][b]Zixiang Zhou[/b] of University Heights Public School ($50)
[*][b]Andrew Lin[/b] of University Hill Secondary School ($50)[/list]The junior division prizewinners are:
[list][*][b]Allan Xu[/b] of Woburn Collegiate Institute ($50)
[*][b]Justin Pu[/b] of William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute ($25)
[*][b]William Fung[/b] of Richmond Hill High School ($25)[/list]Congratulations! These prizes will be distributed as Visa gift cards, and we will be contacting your teachers shortly about sending them out. Remember that we will have many prizes in the remaining rounds of the year, so keep on practicing!

    <pre id="msg7584" style="display: none">Thank you all who joined us for the Woburn Challenge 2015-16 on-site finals this afternoon! After an unbelievably tight race, Richmond Green Secondary School managed to edge out the valiant competition from Don Mills Collegiate Institute (by a mere 1 point within the last 6 minutes of the contest!) to ultimately secure 1st place in the senior division. Meanwhile, Thornhill Secondary School clinched their own champion spot in the junior division. Though this was arguably our toughest contest of the year, we still believe that there was something there for everyone.

The contest problems have been cloned to the main judge: [url=http://wcipeg.com/problem/wc15fj1]J1[/url], [url=http://wcipeg.com/problem/wc15fj2]J2[/url], [url=http://wcipeg.com/problem/wc15fs1]J3/S1[/url], [url=http://wcipeg.com/problem/wc15fs2]J4/S2[/url], [url=http://wcipeg.com/problem/wc15fs3]J5/S3[/url], [url=http://wcipeg.com/problem/wc15fs4]S4[/url], [url=http://wcipeg.com/problem/wc15fs5]S5[/url].
Problems, solutions, and test data will be posted shortly to [url=http://woburnchallenge.com/past-contests/]this[/url] page.
