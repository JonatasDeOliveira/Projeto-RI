I think that (possibily coupled with a notification system once a post of yours gets commented) would be a HUGE improvement overall: I myself see the best submissions page as the prize I get for solving a problem, so being able to interact with other skilled coders would be icing on the cake.

Just suggesting and still very grateful to you all, staff members, and to Brian Bi for linking this site to me back on Quora :)</pre>

[*]In the middle of grading, display which (or at least how many) test cases are remaining on the submission status page so the user has an idea.
[*][s]Some way to efficiently display threads in the main comment feed. Right now, all it takes is a small series of replies to fill it up completely.[/s] Done.
[*][s]Display full announcements on the front page, not just their titles and a link to this page.[/s] Done.
[*][s]In long threads, display only recent replies by default, with the ability to expand and view all replies. Long threads can really get ugly (like this one).[/s] Done.
[*]In conjunction with hiding comments from the feed if they're from different contests (or main judge), have an easy way for the contest setter to post announcements/updates to the main page of the contest. Even support pushing out an alert() box to inform everybody of an update during a contest (like in Codeforces).
[*]Less of a UI chance and more of a general suggestion, but we probably need to be able to control how much output preview is shown for individual problems (especially in contests, where problem-setters might want to disable previewing altogether).
[*]When more development is done on problem-setter support, a nice native Javascript UI to edit problem statements. (I can look into this.)
[*][s]Better search. Searching "The Primes" shouldn't return over 1000 problems in default order simply because MySQL full text search found "the" in all statements. (I can look into this too.)[/s]  Done.
[*]Eventually, we might get too many users so that the rank list has to be split into multiple pages. If we do this, I think we should consider (or at least have an option to enable) showing all users, not just active ones. The prerequisite, of course, is to improve management of spam accounts.
[*]Since "Default" problem sorting is now based on contest problem keys for more flexible problem codes and better grouping, we can support pages that list problems from a particular contest (e.g. an extra line under time/memory limits on ccc14 problem statements saying "From: CCC 2014" with CCC 2014 linking to a page listing problems from CCC 2014). We can even go as far as having back and forward arrows on problem pages to navigate the contest problems. This can be implemented either by examining the categories or contest problem keys of problems.
