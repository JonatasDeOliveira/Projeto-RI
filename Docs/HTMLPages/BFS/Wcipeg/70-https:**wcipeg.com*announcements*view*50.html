[*]The first 5 problems will be released when the contest starts. The last 5 problems will be released later on into the contest.[/list]Good luck!

[b]Update:[/b] Problem F, G, and H have been released.

[b]Update 2:[/b] Due to the rather steep difficulty curve of the problems, the contest setters have decided to only release 8 total problems to prevent the rich from getting richer.
As a result, some problems have been slightly revalued, and the last problem has been designed to be fairly open-ended and interesting to compensate for this change.</pre>

User FatalEagle and I have created a mock CCC for those of you that would like some practice. The contest will be held here, on the PEG Judge, and will be available in the "contests" section of the website. It will take place this weekend, with the contest period opening on Saturday, February 22nd at 9:00AM EST and closing on Sunday, February 23rd at 6:00PM EST. You may enter the contest at any time during the contest period, but once you do, you will have 3 hours to complete five problems.

In fact, there will be two contests running simultaneous during the period - one for the junior division and one for the senior division. You may participate in both of them in the time frame specified above. Both of the contests will be rated. Finally, we have done our best to make the style and difficulty of the problems correspond to the real CCC. Analyses and solutions will be made available after the contest period has ended. There is no need for any "registration" process - just make an account if you don't already have one and check out the earlier contests from the dropdown list to familiarize yourself with the judge's contest interface.

Tell your friends! We hope you enjoy solving the problems as much as we enjoyed making them.</pre>

This does not include interactive problems (which will be added later, when the judge better supports them), but does include those requiring custom graders for many possible outputs. I don't believe any other online judge has a collection that's more complete. :cool:

If you notice any typos in the problem statements, think there is an issue with the test data/graders, or think the problem value is to high/low, please post a comment.

Also, since the IOI's from pre-1994 used a completely different grading model where programs were tested by hand, the official test data is long lost. Contact me if you are interested in writing test data for any of the IOI 1989-1993 tasks.</pre>

    <pre id="msg5616" style="display: none">After noticing a particular submission from someone (you know who you are), I feel that this message needs to be heard, particularly by Churchill PEG members. The admins of this site are really not oblivioua. Looking at a submission, we can easily tell whether someone earned the points for a problem legitimately. We realize for many problems on the PEG Judge, solution descriptions or even solution programs can be found online. There is nothing we can do to stop you from giving yourself a hint by, for instance, reading a few sentences of a solution PDF, and then implementing the program on your own.

The problem arises when you copy somebody else's program, change some variables, add a few sporadic comments, and submit it in one go for a perfect score. This is blatantly cheating. We don't really care about public users doing this since it's their own programming skills that they're trying to improve. There are certainly no merits to copy-pasting code all day long to gain imaginary points on a website. However, among rising programmers in PEG who are consistently competing with each other (for ranks, rewards, trips, etc.), points DO mean something. Thus, we must be particularly strict with enforcement of this policy.

It is very unfortunate that not only did you try to illegitimately obtain 50 points through 1 problem while your peers are working so hard to even earn 30 on several, you decided to brag about solving it on your own in the comments. It is even more unfortunate that you chose to do this right after we all discussed proper use of the PEG Judge last Wednesday. In the past, our leaders/teachers would not have hesitated to kick out students for such offenses. For this one time, the score for your submission has been set to zero. It's never happened before (and we don't plan for it to), but if similar events persist, we just might start seeing negative scores for submissions. Let's learn to be grateful that this tool is available for us.

TL;DR - Just get points legitimately; we're reaching a limit on warnings.</pre>
