According to the “Defense” pattern, robot’s actions are defined as follows: calculate the number of enemies and multiply it by 20. If the result is <b>NOT LESS</b> than the amount of ammunition units left, the robot will “Retreat and Return Fire”. Otherwise, it will act as if following the “Guard” pattern.
</li>

<li>
Similarly, when the battle-robot “Advances and Returns Fire”, it checks the angle to the most dangerous enemy. If the angle is 10 degrees or more, or there are no enemies, the robot just moves <b>FORWARD</b> or shoots otherwise.

<li>
Angle values range from -179 to 180 inclusive, all other integers are non-negative and none of them exceeds <b>1000</b>.

C/C++ Compiler switches changed</div>Switch /O1 was added to command line of C/C++ compiler. This switch is used instead of default /O2 switch. Description from compiler help:<br>
<ul>
<li>/O1 – optimize for maximum speed, but disable some optimizations which increase code size for a small speed benefit
</li><li>/O2 – optimize for maximum speed (DEFAULT)
</li></ul>
ICL compiler sometimes makes wrong code with /O2 switch. To prevent wrong verdicts we have changed switches but loose some performance. Some programs will work a little bit slower now. Current compiler’s command line:
<ul>
<li>For C:<br><code>icl /GX /TC /Za /O1 /D ONLINE_JUDGE</code>
</li><li>For C++:<br><code>icl /GX /TP /Za /O1 /D ONLINE_JUDGE</code>
