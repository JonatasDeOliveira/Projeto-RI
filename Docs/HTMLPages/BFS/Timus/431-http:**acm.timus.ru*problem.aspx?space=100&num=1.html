GOV Chronicles</h2><div class="problem_limits">Time limit: 0.5 second<br>Memory limit: 64 MB<br></div><div id="problem_text"><img src="/image/get.aspx/3ab3f0e2-8af4-428f-ab66-6f8b9285e74c" border="0" alt="Problem illustration" align="RIGHT" class="problem_raimage"><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">A chilly autumn night. Well wrapped up in a coat, a man is rapidly walking 
along a gray street. This is the Tradition Keeper of the ACM club in Ural 
State University. Drizzle and dull sky have always turned him 
nostalgic. And here we go again, the Tradition Keeper is bringing back the 
memories of distant past when Ural Federal University wasn't yet existing, 
and the story of Team.GOV was only starting. Indeed, this story deserves 
to be preserved for descendants. However, the details are slipping from 
the Keeper's mind and he seems to need an archive. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">4 Turgeneva st. The sixth floor, home Department of Mathematics and 
Mechanics where the Keeper himself has been studying a long time ago. Long 
corridors, narrow light bars on the floor, dark corners and eventually an 
office with ACM archive. The Keeper opened the door and found himself in a 
cramp room with numerous racks. Dozens of boxes and piles of paper are 
dumped near the walls. On one box three letters glittered with gold&nbsp;— GOV. 
The Keeper stepped to the box, drew a heavy file and opened it. On the 
first page in the right upper corner there was a photo of a smiling young 
man with curly hair and a subscript: “Vadik Kantorov, the permanent 
captain of Team.GOV”. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Right after Vadik had entered University he played a few tricks and got into 
the half-ready team of Alex E. and Misha. Alex E. had been a bright 
programmer even he was a schoolar and so troubled the ACM old-timers. Thus, Alex E. 
was ready to name the team: “Alarm”. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">So the Vadik's ACM-career began. The team existed during a year. 
The first battle was the Ural SU Championship where Alarm
took only the fifth place and allayed the veterans' fear. Next 
contest was the ACM ICPC subregional contest. The team played slightly better 
and took the seventh place out of all teams from Ural region, and the 
third out of teams from Ural SU. Alarm became the third freshmen 
team in the Ural SU history to qualify for the regional contest in St. Petersburg. 
Unfortunately, on the regional contest the team scored 86th and broke the 
record of lowest position of Ural SU teams. It 
was a hard hit for the team. The choice had to be made: practice a lot, 
leave programming contests or keep performing poorly. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Putting back the decision, the team participated in the Ural Championship, 
and scored 19th of all teams and 5th of Ural SU teams. That very moment it 
became clear that the line-up had to change. However, before the Ural 
Championship Alarm had applied to the Tatarstan Championship where the 
team's final battle took place. The team could not even solve a half of the 
offered problems and did not make in the best ten teams (11th place). On 
the way back in a train it was decided that Misha had to <a href="/problem.aspx?space=1&amp;num=1728">quit the team</a>.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">In the new season the team needed a new name. Here the preamble is 
completed and the story of Team.GOV commences. The team consisted of two 
members having little experience and even less success. A new name was 
defined&nbsp;— Team.GOV. After long considerations Vadik figured out that the 
team missed a strong mathematician. Sasha who had been Vadik's high school 
friend was picked to fill this role. With Sasha's appearance everyone felt 
that everything was going to run smoothly. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The time of Ural SU Championship came, the autumn of 2008, second 
university year. In unclear circumstances Sasha has not come to the 
contest, but even in that case Team.GOV was second best of Ural SU teams. 
One-year experience paid off! Sasha did come to the subregional contest 
but the team reached only 14th place and did not qualify for the regional 
contest. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Luckily, Ural SU as the host of the subregional contests has a right to 
send one extra team to the regional contest. After long negotiations 
Team.GOV could make it to the regional contest but with <a href="/problem.aspx?space=1&amp;num=1688">a sudden change</a> in the line-up&nbsp;— Ivan B. came instead of Sasha. The replacement turned out to be fruitful&nbsp;— 76th place (+10 to Alarm's achievement).</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">After returning home Ivan B. found another team, thus Team.GOV had to fix 
the line-up again. Nikita was invited as the third player for the Ural 
Championship. On the qualification contest Vadik, Nikita and Alex E. played 
very well: the team scored second of Ural SU teams. 
Truly an astounding success! </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Being very enthusiastic Vadik and Nikita came to the Ural Championship. 
For some strange reason Alex E. did not come. The team performed very poorly 
yet another time&nbsp;— 25th place of all teams and 5th of Ural SU teams. 
Nikita was not satisfied with such attitude and Team.GOV became only two players
again&nbsp;— Alex E. and Vadik. What a curse! The team started to search for the 
third player. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">And the next season came&nbsp;— it's been two years since Vadik entered Ural 
SU. The search for the third teammate was completed successfully. Senior 
student Fedor was very experienced and had been practicing since 9th 
grade of high school. Bright future was ahead of the team. 
The curse was over and Team.GOV played three official contests 
with the same line-up. The team scored 12th on the subregional contest, 
safely advanced to the regional, and then took the third place on the Ural 
SU Championship. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The regional contest in St. Petersburg yielded a diploma and the 61st 
place, which was +15 to the previous year's position. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Having returned from St. Petersburg, Team.GOV participated in a unique 
competition of ACM ICPC veterans and current teams&nbsp;— Battle of 
Generations. Sadly, Alex E. couldn't come but team figured it out&nbsp;— Ivan K. 
came to the rescue and replaced Alex E. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Alex E. wasn't keeping fit: no practice, light attitude to contests&nbsp;— Vadik 
began to look for a replacement. Nikita accepted the invitation cheerfully 
once he heard of Alex E. quitting the team. The first contest after his 
return to Team.GOV was qualification for the Ural Championship. 
Suddenly Vadik had some urgent business in Europe, so Fedor and Nikita 
participated without him. They performed quite well and solved as many problems 
as the leaders did. As a result, the team got the third place and 
qualified for the Ural Championship. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The Ural Championship brought a new grief: 25th place out of all teams, 
and 4th out of Ural SU teams. Fedor and Nikita couldn't hold the nerves, 
and Vadik had to look for new teammates all over again. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The fourth and the last year of university. Vadik wanted to put an end to 
his ACM-career and he needed a new team. The veterans recommended to take 
young and promising Den. Vadik conducted a little test, and <a href="/problem.aspx?space=1&amp;num=1851">Den was taken</a>. Only a few days were left before the Ural SU Championship, almost all the teams were formed, while Vadik was still answering his eternal question&nbsp;— where to get the third team member? Accidentally he found that Egor was looking for a new team after his previous team broke apart. A new line-up 
of Team.GOV was born. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">On the Ural SU Championship Team.GOV failed again and got only 5th place. 
Subregional contest wasn't successful as well&nbsp;— 9th place out of all 
teams and 4th out of Ural SU teams. Ural SU got an extended quota and 
Team.GOV was going to St. Petersburg again. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Before St. Petersburg Team.GOV needed a serious practice session. 
All-Siberian Olympiad was a perfect shot. Team.GOV went to Novosibirsk and 
discovered again how weak they were: 39th place out of all teams and the 
worst performance out of Ural SU teams. So the guys set out to St. 
Petersburg with great leisure plans. Well, taking part counts no less than 
victory! </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">On the regional contest, surprisingly for the coaches, Team.GOV scored 
five problems in the first four hours and was quite high ranked. After the contest the coaches 
discovered that the team scored not only the sixth problem but also a 
seventh one. The result&nbsp;— 26th place (+35 to the last year's position) 
and a second grade diploma. Team.GOV finally reached success and glory. 
<a href="/problem.aspx?space=1&amp;num=1859">The road back home</a> was ahead.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The spring, Team.GOV traditionally broke up. Vadik wanted to do something 
fancy, it was his last contest after all. Vadik <a href="/problem.aspx?space=100&amp;num=7">invites</a> his Chinese girlfriend 
Xiaohong. The 
third invited teammate unfortunately didn't come, so on the last minute 
Vadik took Vitaliy (medal winner of ACM ICPC World Finals) for the Game 
Tournament before the Ural Championship. Unfortunately, Vitaliy could not participate in the main 
contest, so Vadik took Sasha as an old friend. This was the last contest 
of Team.GOV. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The Tradition Keeper scratched his head: in how many Alarm / Team.GOV 
contests has every team member participated? Vadik had always told that 
Misha is the member number zero, because he had played in Team.GOV before 
the team got its name. Vadik is indeed player number one. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">There's a tricky case with Vitaliy: of course he hasn't taken part in any 
Team.GOV contest, Game Tournament shouldn't be counted. But he definitely 
deserves to be included in the history of Team.GOV, because he is an award winner 
of World Finals and a valuable player in general. </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The Tradition Keeper meticulously listed all the members of Team.GOV. 
(Misha&nbsp;— 0, Vadik&nbsp;— 1, Alex E.&nbsp;— 2, Sasha&nbsp;— 3, Ivan&nbsp;B.&nbsp;— 4, 
Nikita&nbsp;— 5, Fedor&nbsp;— 6, Ivan K.&nbsp;— 7, Den&nbsp;— 8, Egor&nbsp;— 9,
Xiaohong&nbsp;— 10, Vitaliy&nbsp;— 11). He counted that a number zero has played 
for 5 times (because exactly 5 contests were played by Alarm). And a number 
one participated in 21 contests.  </div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Did you think that was it? After graduating from Ural Federal University, Vadik has moved to Paris and participated again in an ACM ICPC contest three years after . Vadik and two his teammates (Timothée and Alexandre) got to travel to Valencia to take part in the SWERC regional contest. All they achieved was solving two problems and reaching the 29th place. This makes a sad end of ACM ICPC career of Vadik, this was his final fifth attempt at the regional contests.

</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">P.S.
