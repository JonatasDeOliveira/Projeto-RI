<h3>Sane's Monthly Algorithms Challenge: November 2008</h3>

<h2>Intelligent Stats (Guru Level)<br>

</h2>
You are a computer scientist for a popular online game which hosts
one-on-one chess games between players across the world. After each
game, the username of both players is recorded in the website's
database, along with the username of the player who won.<br>
<br>
The website has statistics for the Wins and Losses of each player.
However, these statistics are poor representations since the most
active members can increase their win count by 'picking' on bad players
with low win-loss ratios. Some also cheat by playing against their own
alternate accounts.<br>
<br>
To help reduce this problem, they want to add an intelligent stat to
each user, which indicates how many players the user “can” beat, given
the playing history of all players and the following logical rule:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Player <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> beat Player <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span> if and only if Player <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> and Player <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span> have different usernames <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Player <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has</span> beat Player<span style="font-weight: bold;"> B</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">or</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Player <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has</span> beat Player <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span> and Player <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can</span> beat Player <span style="font-weight: bold;">B</span>.<br>
<br>
This statistic will hopefully provide an incentive for users to compete
against better players, and to not repeatedly pick on the same person.<br>
<br>
Your job is, given the database of playing history, generate the
database containing this new statistical attribute for each player.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<h3>Input</h3>
The first line contains an integer <code>n</code> (1 ≤ <code>n</code> ≤ 10,000).<br>
<br>
The next <code>n</code> lines each contain two alphanumeric names of lengths no
longer than 20, separated by a space. This line indicates that the
first user “has” beat the second user. Names are case sensitive. A
player can never play against himself.
<h3>Output</h3>
On the first line, output an integer <code>k</code> (2 ≤ <code>k</code> ≤ 20,000), representing the number of distinct names mentioned in the input file.<br>
<br>
For each of the next <code>k</code> lines to follow, output a name you have not yet
mentioned in the output file, followed by the number of users he/she
“can” beat (the order of the output file does not matter).<br>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">7<br>
Jim Denise<br>
Noobie111 AwesumChessPlyr1337<br>
