Statistical Trouble</h2><div class="problem_limits">Time limit: 1.0 second<br>Memory limit: 64 MB<br></div><div id="problem_text"><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Your team was hired by the international corporation ACM
(Analytical Calculation Maxims). Every year ACM creates and
conducts various surveys. Surveys themselves are simple forms
with a list of questions and a list of possible answers for
every question. Surveys are distributed around the globe,
where field agents question the target group of people.
All the answers are gathered in the ICPC
(International Computation and Processing Center), where
teams of well-paid analysts mine raw data in
search for relevant correlations. The raw data for each
individual survey consists of lots of lines of answers.
Each line corresponds to every questioned person and
for every question lists answers that the person has
made on that particular survey.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The first step of analysis that your team was 
hired to automate is to create cross tables that 
correlate answers on interesting pairs of questions.
In its most simple way, given a pair of questions,
cross table has a row for every possible answer
on the first question, and has a column for every possible
answer on the second question. Each cell of the cross
table contains a number of lines in the raw data that
has both answers for the corresponding questions at
the same time.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">However, your task is complicated by the fact that
you are to compute and output not only simple cross
table values, but also total values for every row and
column in the cross table (that is the sum of values in the
corresponding row and column) that are placed in an
additional last column and last row, as well as
a percentage distributions for every row and column.
Percentage distribution for a row is an additional number
in every cell in that row that shows percent ratio
of the value in that cell to the total value for that
row, unless the total value is zero (in that case
percentage distribution for this row is not defined).
The same applies to the percentage distributions of
columns. Thus, the cross table in your output will have 
at most three values in every cell (the value itself,
row-wise percent, and column-wise percent). 
Please note, that percentage distributions also apply
to totals. For example, in the total column for every 
row the row-wise percent will be always 100%, unless
the total value for the row is zero (in that case 
row-wise percents are not defined), and column-wise
percent shows percents ratio of the total value for this
row to the total number of lines in the raw data (which
is the value that can be found in the last column
of the last row).</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Percents are rounded to integers on output. 
Percent that has a non-zero fractional part
is rounded to either the smallest integer number greater 
than the resulting percent, or the largest integer number 
smaller than the resulting percent, in such a way, that 
the sums of all corresponding row-wise percents by row 
(without row totals) or column-wise percents by column
(without column totals) are equal to 100% unless they
are undefined. There are various rounding algorithms 
that produce results satisfying the above constraints. 
You are free to use any rounding algorithm as long as
the above constraints are satisfied.</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Input</h3><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The input consists of 3 sections: survey description,
survey results, and cross table descriptions.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The first line of the input contains the name of the
survey, which is at most 100 characters long. Subsequent lines describe all the questions in the survey. On the first
line of every question there is a 3-character question code
(capital letters and digits only) followed by a space, and followed by the question name, which is at most 80 characters long. Each subsequent line for a question describes one possible answer on the question and starts with a space, followed by a single-character code for the
answer (capital letter, digit, or character '.', '*', or '@'), followed by a space and followed by an answer description, which is at most 40 characters long. The list of questions is terminated by the line with a single character '#'. All answer codes are unique within the question, and all question codes are unique within the input. There are at least 2 and at most 10 possible answers per question and at least 2 and at most 100 questions.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Next lines in the input describe survey results. Every line contains a character per question (in the order they appear in the input) that gives the answer code for the corresponding question. The characters follow one another without any delimiters. This section is terminated by the line with a single character '#'. There is at least one line with answers in the section and at most 10000 answers in total (the number of lines times the number of questions).</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Next lines in the input describe cross tables that are to be created. Each cross table description occupies one line. That line contains the code for the first question, followed by a space, followed by the different code for the second question, followed by a space, and followed by the cross table name, which is at most 100 characters
long. This section is terminated by the line with a single character '#'. There are at most 100 cross table descriptions in the input.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The input has no trailing spaces on any line. All names do not start or end with a space, but may contain spaces.</div></div><h3 class="problem_subtitle">Output</h3><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">Write to the output a cross table for every cross table description in the input in the order they appear in the input. On the first line of the cross table write the survey name, followed by a space, followed by a '-' (dash) character, followed by a space, followed by the cross table name. Then write the description of the first question,
and the description of the second question exactly as they appear in the input and in the same format. Then write an empty line, followed by the table itself. The table contains exactly <tt>1+3*(N1+1)</tt> lines and exactly <tt>6*(N2+2)</tt> characters on every line, where <tt>N1</tt> is the number of possible answers for the first question, and <tt>N2</tt> is the number of possible answers for the second question.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The table has one line for column headings, and <tt>N1+1</tt> rows (3 lines per row). The first <tt>N1</tt> of these rows correspond to the answers on the first question in the order they appear in the input, and the last row is for column totals. The table also has <tt>N2+2</tt> columns, where each column is 6 characters wide. The first column is for row headings; the subsequent <tt>N2</tt> columns correspond to the answers on the second question in the order they appear in the input, and the last column is for row totals. All information in the cells (including headings) is aligned to the right and is padded on the left with spaces to become 6 characters wide.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">The heading for the first column is empty. The headings for the subsequent <tt>N2</tt> columns are composed from the second question code, followed by a ':' (colon) character, and followed by the corresponding answer code. The
heading for the last column is the string "TOTAL" (without quotes). The headings for the first <tt>N1</tt> 3-line rows of the cross table are composed from the first question code, followed by a ':' (colon) character, and followed by the corresponding answer code. The heading for the last row is the string "TOTAL" (without quotes). Row headings are situated on the first line of the corresponding row. The subsequent 2 lines in the heading column of every row must be blank.</div></div><div class="problem_par"><div class="problem_par_normal">All non-heading cells in the table contain computed values and percents. On the first line of every cell the corresponding cross table integer value is situated. The second line contains properly rounded to integers row-wise percent, with a mandatory trailing '%' (percent) character, or a single '-' (dash) character if the corresponding row-wise percent is not defined. The third line contains column-wise percent in the same format. All cross tables in the output must be separated by a single empty line.
