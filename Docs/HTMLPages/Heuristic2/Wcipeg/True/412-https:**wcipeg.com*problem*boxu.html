<h2 align="center">Union Laser</h2>

<p>Doctor Y, a leading expert in the field of boxology, is investigating the properties of boxen with his expensive super-precision laser. In particular, he plans to position the laser inside the union of a bunch of axis-aligned boxen, and see where the beam collides with itself.</p>

<p>Since Doctor Y blew all his cash on the laser, he can't actually afford to purchase boxen to conduct his experiment - instead, he will simulate it on his old computer, which uses an integer grid system. He will give his computer an integer <var>N</var>, the number of boxen (1 ≤ <var>N</var> ≤ 10,000), as well as their descriptions. Each box is described by 4 integers - <var>x</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>y</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>x</var><sub>2</sub> and <var>y</var><sub>2</sub>, such that (-3000 ≤ <var>x</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>x</var><sub>2</sub> ≤ 3000) and (-3000 ≤ <var>y</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>y</var><sub>2</sub> ≤ 3000), where (<var>x</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>y</var><sub>1</sub>) and (<var>x</var><sub>2</sub>, <var>y</var><sub>2</sub>) are any two opposite corners of the box. Note that some boxen may have an area of 0 - these do not contribute to the union. He will also input the location of the laser (<var>A</var>, <var>B</var>) such that (-3000 ≤ <var>A</var>, <var>B</var> ≤ 3000) and such that it will be positioned strictly within the box union. The laser points down and right at a 45° angle.</p>

<p>As it turns out, boxen are made of a perfectly reflective material (a fact which Doctor Y will discover upon the completion of his experiment) - as such, whenever the laser beam hits the edge of the box union, it bounces off. For example, if it hits a vertical edge from the left, it bounces to the right, with the up-down direction preserved. If it hits a corner head-on, it will reverse direction, hence colliding with itself right at the corner. Normally, light travels quite fast, but due to the mysterious properties of boxen, the speed of light when inside a box union is only √2 units/second.</p>

<p>Doctor Y plans to use his computer to simulate the paths of the lasers and see when and where they first collide, but there's one problem - the only program on his computer is C++! Offering non-cafeteria food, he lures a desperate Waterloo student into his lab, where he forces him (or her?) to write the laser simulation program. That's you!</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<table id="input-table">
<tbody><tr>
    <td>Line 1:</td>
    <td>A single integer - <var>N</var></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Line 2:</td>
    <td>Two integers - <var>A</var> and <var>B</var></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The next <var>N</var> lines:</td>
    <td>Four integers - <var>x</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>y</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>x</var><sub>2</sub> and <var>y</var><sub>2</sub></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>If the laser beam never collides with itself of the laser, simply output "<code>Time limit exceeded</code>".<br>
If the laser beam collides with the actual laser before it collides with itself, the first line of output should consist of a single number - the amount of time that passes before the laser beam collides with the laser, in seconds. The second line should read "<code>Broken equipment</code>".<br>
Otherwise, the first line of output should consist of a single number - the amount of time that passes before laser beam first collides with itself, in seconds. The second line should contain a pair of numbers - the X and Y coordinates of where this takes place, respectively.<br>
Each number should be rounded off to 1 decimal place.</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>7
0 4
-1 -1 1 5
0 -2 4 2
0 2 1 -4
5 -4 2 -1
5 2 7 4
3 -5 4 -4
0 -6 3 -4</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>12.0
0.0 0.0</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>The grid looks like this:<br><br>
<img src="images/boxu/boxu.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The filled-in squares represent squares that are part of at least one box - together, they make up the box union. Note that the union can have holes in it, and that it can be disjoint.<br>
The blue lines denote the boundaries of the union - these are the lines that the laser can bounce off of.<br>
The yellow lines are edges of boxen that do not contribute to the union - the laser can go through these freely.<br>
The red diamond is the position of the laser, and the red line is the path that the laser beam follows.<br>
Note that when it bounces off the corner at (2, -2), since it didn't hit it head-on, it is the same as bouncing off of a horizontal edge.</p>

<p>Following the path of the laser beam, it can be seen that it collides with itself at (0, 0). Before this, it has travelled 12√2 units, which takes exactly 12 seconds.</p>

<h3>More Examples</h3>
<p>If the laser were positioned at (0, 3), the output should be:</p>
<pre>12.0
0.0 -1.0</pre>
<p>If the laser were positioned at (0, 1), the output should be:</p>
<pre>5.0
5.0 -4.0</pre>
<p>If the laser were positioned at (0, 0), the output should be:</p>
<pre>8.0
Broken equipment</pre></div>

I don't see why there should be boxes with no area to begin with, but these boxes don't change the box union in my program, so it might be a problem with the judge, or the problem statement.

Can the laser travel inside of empty boxes or something which wasn't clear?
