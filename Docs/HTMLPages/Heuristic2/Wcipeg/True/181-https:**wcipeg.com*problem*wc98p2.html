<h3>Woburn Challenge 1998</h3>
<h2>Episode 2: The Hutts Strike back (Will Han be Spared?)</h2>

<p> Han Solo is deep in debt to Pizza the Hutt and Atilla the Hutt, Jabba's lesser 
  known but equally blobular cousins. Together, Jabba, Atilla and Pizza form a 
  deadly trio known as the The Other Three Tenors. Pizza, being the nice blob 
  that he is, has made Han an offer he can't refuse to rectify the situation. 
  He has challenged Han to a game of bowling - if Han loses, he will face the 
  ultimate punishment of being put in a holding cell listening to recordings of 
  C3PO's infernal whining for the rest of his life. Unfortunately, the Hutt family 
  have been cursed with no elbows and thus can't bowl; so instead they have hired 
  Peter "Three Thumbs" Plachta to bowl for him.Your job is to write a program 
  that will tally up the scores so that they can determine who wins.</p>
<p>In case you're unfamiliar with the rules of bowling, here's how it works: </p>
<ol>
  <li>There are 10 frames - in each frame, both bowlers, in turn, get 2 throws 
    to try to knock down as many of the 10 pins as possible (the 10th frame is 
    an exception - see below) </li>
  <li>If a bowler fails to knock down all the pins, he is assigned a score based 
    on the number of pins he knocks down (between 0 and 9) in each throw. At the 
    beginning of each bowler's turn, all the pins are reset, ie. all 10 pins are 
    put back up.</li>
  <li>If a bowler knocks down all the 10 pins on the first throw, he is awarded 
    a Strike and that bowler does not get a 2nd throw in that frame (except in 
    the 10th frame). If a bowler knocks down all 10 pins in two throws, he is 
    awarded a Spare. </li>
  <li>If a bowler is awarded a Strike, he gets 10 points for that frame AND he 
    also counts his scores from <b>the next 2 throws</b> towards his score on 
    the current frame (of course, those throws also count for the frame in which 
    they are actually bowled). If a bowler is awarded a Spare, he gets 10 points 
    for that frame AND he also counts his score from <b>the next throw</b> towards 
    his score on the current frame. </li>
  <li>If a bowler bowls a Strike in the 10th (final) frame, he gets 2 more throws 
    to add to the Strike. If he bowls a Spare in the 10th frame, he gets 1 more 
    throw to add to the Spare. <b>Those throws don't count on their own - they 
    only count towards the Strike or Spare</b>. You get at most 3 throws in the 
    10th frame. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
  The first line of the input will be the number of bowlers.<br>
  Following this is the result of each throw by each bowler (X = Strike, / = Spare, 
  0..9=knocked # of pins down).<br>
  There may be anywhere between 1 and 5 bowlers given - each bowler will be on 
  a different line. </p>
<p>Note: There is no space between throws in a frame (so for the example below, 
  in the 1st frame, on the first throw, 2 pins were knocked down and on the second 
  throw, 2 more pins were knocked down).<br>
  Frames are separated using 1 hyphen.<br>
  If a strike was bowled in a frame, there is no 2nd throw in that frame and so 
  there is a blank space in the data file after the X to signify that there was 
  no 2nd throw. </p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
  Output the total score of each player as shown in the example below: 
</p>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>2
22-4/-X -55-42-X -X -4/-54-23
X -X -X -X -X -X -X -X -X -XXX
</pre>

<p>Sample calculation for player 1 (score for each frame is shown after considering 
  subsequent throws if strike/spare):<br>
  4 - 20 - 20 - 10 - 6 - 24 - 20 - 15 - 9 - 5 =&gt; total = 133<br>
  Sample for player<br>
  2 30 - 30 - 30 - 30 - 30 - 30 - 30 - 30 - 30 - 30 =&gt; total = 300 (maximum score) 
</p>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>133
300
