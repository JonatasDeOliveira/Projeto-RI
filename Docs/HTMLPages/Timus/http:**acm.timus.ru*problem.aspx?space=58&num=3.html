and other vermin. The track all movements of our alien foes and friends
and control their actions. But recently the government has learned
about men in black and decided to track all their movements.</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">There are several agents. Each agent has several characteristics:
accuracy, intelligence, walking speed, experience, driving skill.
All characteristics are real numbers ranging from 0 to 1. 
Also each agent has a code letter "A" to "Z", since his name
is top secret. When the new agent comes to the organization
he is assigned a letter closest to first letter of the agent name,
that is not assigned to any agent. If
there are several such letters, the one which goes first lexicographically
is chosen. For example, if there are already agents "J", "K" and "L"
in the organization, and the agent with the name "Killer"
comes, he gets letter "I".
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Men in black have several cars that agents use in their work.
The speed of the agent when driving is equal to his driving skill.
But some cars require the agent that drives it to have a
driving skill greater or equal to some predefined value.
Each car has some distance that it can pass before it can
no longer be used.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">There are several kinds of alien monsters in the universe that 
men in black fight with. The agent can kill monster if
his experience and his intelligence are greater or equal
to some predefine values for this kind of monsters. Each 
kind of monsters has evasiveness, and depending on
agent's accuracy it can take different time to kill a monster.
A killed monster gives the agent who has killed him
some experience.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">There are four types of quests that men in black perform.

<ol>
<li> 
 Delivery quest&nbsp;— get from the office to the 
 destination point and back. For such quests the distance
 from the office to the destination point is given.
</li>
<li>
 Kill the monster quest&nbsp;— get to the monster, kill him,
 get back. For such quest you are given a distance to the
 monster and its kind. The time that an agent with accuracy
 <i>a</i> needs to kill a monster with evasiveness <i>e</i> is equal to <i>e</i>/<i>a</i>.
 The agent gets (1&minus;<i>x</i>)·<i>m</i>/<i>maxx</i> experience,
 here <i>x</i> is the experience of the agent, 
 <i>m</i> is some experience value that is associated with this
 kind of monsters, and <i>maxx</i> is the theoretically 
 maximal experience value. Agent's
 accuracy increases by (1&minus;<i>a</i>)·<i>e</i>/<i>maxe</i> where <i>maxe</i>
 is the maximal theoretically possible evasiveness of monsters.
</li>
<li>
 Investigation&nbsp;— get to the point where the investigation
 is needed, perform it, get back. For such quest you are
 given a distance to the investigation point, and the minimal
 intelligence required to perform the investigation.
 The time needed to perform investigation by an agent
 with intelligence <i>i</i> is <i>mint</i>/<i>i</i> where <i>mint</i> is the minimal
 time required to perform this investigation. After completing
 the investigation the agent gets (1&minus;<i>x</i>)·<i>i</i>/<i>mint</i> experience,
 where <i>x</i> is agent's experience before the operation.
 His intelligence increases by (1&minus;<i>i</i>)·<i>i</i>/<i>mint</i>.
</li>
<li>
 Negotiations&nbsp;— get to the point of negotiations, discuss
 hot issues, get back. You are given the distance from the office
 to the negotiations point, and the minimal experience of an
 agent that can take part in negotiations. The time needed
 for an agent with experience <i>x</i> 
 to complete the discussion is equal <i>mint</i>/<i>x</i>
 where <i>mint</i> is the minimal time needed. After the negotiations
 the agent gets (1&minus;<i>x</i>)·<i>x</i>/<i>mint</i> additional experience.
</li>
</ol>
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">Each quest can be performed by one or two agents. If two agents
perform the same quest, after it their characteristics change as if each
of them completed this quest by himself. Agent can walk to the location
where the quest must be performed, or drive there. If the car
breaks while the agent is driving, he must continue to walk
to the location he was driving to. If the quest is performed
by two agents, they can use the same car to get to its location.

</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">The following algorithm is used to choose an agent or a pair of 
agents to perform the quest. An agent (a pair of agents) is chosen
that would perform the quest in smallest time. If there are
several possibilities, the following tie breaking rules are used.
If it is possible to choose one agent or a pair of agents, one
agent is chosen. If there are two candidate agents, the one who has 
the smaller letter assigned is chosen (for pairs of agents
the ordered pairs of letters are compared). <b>Agents always choose a car 
in such a way to perform their quest in smallest time.</b> If the quest
is completed without using a car in the same time, the car
is not used. If there are several cars available 
<b>with the same quest performing time</b>, the car with
the lexicographically smaller id is chosen.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">All quests are performed as soon as they can be performed.
If there are several quests available, the one that was
received earlier is performed first.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">After the agent completed the quest where he had to walk,
his walking speed increases by (1&minus;<i>s</i>)·<i>d</i>/<i>maxd</i> where
<i>s</i> is his walking speed before the quest, <i>d</i> is the distance
he walked while performing the quest, <i>maxd</i> is the maximal
possible walking distance. If the agent was driving
a car for some distance, his driving skill increases by 
(1&minus;<i>z</i>)·<i>d</i>/<i>maxd</i> where <i>z</i> is the driving skill of the agent
before the quest, <b><i>d</i> is the distance he driven while performing the quest</b>.
</DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="problem_par"><DIV CLASS="problem_par_normal">When the pair of agents perform the quest, the characteristics
of the pair are calculated using the following algorithm.
Pair's walking speed is minimum of agents' walking speeds, 
pair's driving skill is maximum of agents' driving skills,
pair's accuracy is (<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>a</i><sub>2</sub>)/2,
pair's experience is 1&minus;(1&minus;<i>e</i><sub>1</sub>)·(1&minus;<i>e</i><sub>2</sub>), pair's
