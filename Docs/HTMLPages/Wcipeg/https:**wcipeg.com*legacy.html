</tr><br><br>

<tr><p>11/13/2008 - Some updates over the past 3 months: <br>
<b>DWITE:</b> Due to some errors in their test data, Brian and Hanson only placed 6th and 9th, respectively. Toby was 17th, while Jacob ended up 28th. A good effort by all who participated!<br>
The next round is on Nov. 20th.<br>

Andy and Scott were not too far behind.
<br></p></tr><br><br>

<tr><p>08/24/2008 - Hanson is back from the IOI and brought back a gold medal. This is an accomplishment that can be put on par with the olympic gold medals (should be 4 medals now!). 
Hanson has trained with dedication and earned this gold medal. As the Beijing Olympics ends, this news post will also be my last for this site and I hope that everybody can look up to Hanson as a role model. It shows that not only 
talent can win a medal but hard work and dedication that really makes the difference. On behalf of our grade 12 year, I would like to say that we were honoured to be taught by Mrs. Plachta and we enjoyed teaching 
the juniors. This year was a great year (like every year) as we accomplished many goals and surpassed some. Also, be sure to congratulate Guru for entering stage 2 of Google Code Jam (going to compete in NYC) and for being an amazing president of PEG this year. 
We will be missing PEG as we have gained wonderful memories, knowledge and friends. Thank You and Good Luck to the future of PEG. <br>(We will be coming back here sometimes and we also hope to update the site again to incorporate a judge).     <br></p></tr><br><br>

<tr><p>06/01/2008 - News from the CCC has arrived from Waterloo. Hanson Wang finished second 
in Canada and he won the gold medal. He will be representing Canada at the International Olympiad 
in Informatics(IOI) to be held in August in Egypt as one of the top four Canadian students to attend the event. 
Three of our students (Brian Bi , Guru Guruganesh and Jacob Plachta) won silver medals and two of our students (David Teng and Colman Ing) 
won bronze medals. Congratulations to all of these students (especially Hanson)!   <br></p></tr><br><br>

<tr><p>05/27/2008 - Earlier in the week our 3 teams (senior, junior and intermediate) competed in the ASCL. 
The junior team finished third with one point behind second place. They got perfect in programming (in fact all 
our teams got perfect in programming) , but did not do so well in short questions. Compared to the rest of the competition they
were the only grade 7 students compared to the other juniors who were in grade 9. Our senior team also finished 3rd and were also 
and lost on the fourth tie breaker to second place. We did manage to take first place with our intermediate team. The short questions
 were really hard this year (but Brian got perfect). Congratulations to all the teams and good luck to those of you in the CCC.  <br></p></tr><br><br>

<tr><p>05/15/2008 -  Today was the final round of ECOO with two of our teams who made it through to the finals. Unfortunately, Woburn #2 could not place but Woburn #1 (Guru Guruganesh, Hanson Wang, Conan Huang and Ray Yau) placed first place and once again inscribed our school onto the ECOO trophy.
This is twice in a row so lets try to make it a hat trick! <br></p></tr><br><br>

<tr><p>05/06/2008 -  The final standings for ACSL were released. The senior team placed first and the junior team tied for first. Good job to both teams.<br></p></tr><br><br>

<tr><p>05/05/2008 - Today was the ECOO Stage 2 for Central and Western divisions of ontario. Both woburn teams had trouble on question 4 but managed to move on to the finals. 
Woburn team #1 placed 3rd and Woburn #2 placed 6th. Recently there was the US Open hosted by USACO. In the proctored US Open Hanson Wang finsihed 9th in the gold division. 
David Teng finished 3rd in the silver division and got promoted to gold division while Jacob Plachta finished 7th. Last but not least, Colman Ing finished 3rd in the bronze division 
and got promoted to the silver division. For most of the PEG members PEG is already over and only active and members participating in the ASCL are required to come to meetings.  <br></p></tr><br><br>

<tr><p>04/06/2008 - Yesterday was ECOO's regional competition and 3 of our teams were competing with 50 other teams from different schools in the region.
 Woburn team #1(Guru, Hanson, Conan and Ray) took first place and Woburn team #2(Colman, David, Jacob and Harun) took second place. Both teams will be moving on and will compete
again in early May. The third woburn team tried their best and came close to moving on but placed 15th. Good try and good job teams! 
<br></p></tr><br><br>

<tr><p>04/03/2008 - It has been a long while since we've updated with news but we do have good news to share. During March 
The TopCoder world finals were held at the Purdue University over the March break. 49 top programmers from around the world were invited and
 Hanson finished 12th. In the last USACO two of our students got a perfect score. Lucia Li and Harun Mustafa got a score of 1000 in bronze
 division and will be moving up to the silver division. Guru and Jacob got very high scores in their divisions. All three ACSL team won an
 early invitation to the finals. Our senior team is right now first in their division,
 and our junior team is tied for second place. 13 students will be going to the final stage held in Maryland at the end of May. In relation to the last new posts the CCC invitations were announced.
 The cut off mark was 66 and 6 of our students were invited to the second stage (out of 22 from all of Canada). This is our (and any school's in Canada) record. 
 Brian Bi, Guru Guruganesh, Hanson Wang and Jacob Plachta all received perfects and ranked 1st in the contest. Colman Ing and David Teng ranked high enough to be invited into second stage. Congratulations to all of these students.<br></p></tr><br><br>


<tr><p>02/27/2008 - Yesterday, 19 students of Woburn took part in the CCC(Canadian Computing Competition). 
Four of those students got a perfect score 75/75 which is not only the Woburn record, but the Canadian record - in 
the history of this contest there have never been more than two perfect scores in the whole country; 
we never had more than one. These students are Hanson Wang, Guru Guruganesh, Brian Bi and Jacob Plachta. 
These students will make it to second stage. Two other students who achieved high scores were, David Teng 
who achieved a score of 72 and Colman Ing who achieved a score of 68 may get invited to second stage. Congratulations!
and I am sure the rest of you tried your best and here are the final results (out of 75).

<tr><p>09/09/2007 - If you've noticed anything different with the site, then you've realised that we have included RSS feeds. That means feeds will be generated everytime this site is updated. You can view RSS feeds in different applications. This includes Google's personalized homepages, your cell phone, and even your PSP. This is so you can keep in touch with PEG anywhere and anytime. There are two feeds available: one for news and another for events. If you have Firefox, you can click the orange box in the url to subscribe to either of them or use these links:<a href="http://wcipeg.com/pegfeeds.xml">http://wcipeg.com/pegfeeds.xml</a> and <a href="http://wcipeg.com/pegeventfeeds.xml">http://wcipeg.com/pegeventfeeds.xml.</a> In the future more feeds may become available, such as the rankings, but that requires a little more tweaking. I hope you all enjoy this update and make use of these RSS feeds.<br></p></tr><br><br>
